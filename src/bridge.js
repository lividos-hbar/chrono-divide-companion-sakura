/**
 * Isolated-world half of the extension.
 *
 * companion.js has to run in the page's MAIN world to reach SystemJS and React
 * fibers — and that world has no `chrome.*`. This file is the other half: it
 * owns extension storage and talks to the page over window.postMessage.
 *
 *   page   -> bridge : { source: "cdc-page",   type: "ready" | "map-seen" | "map-render" |
 *                                                     "prefs-set" | … }
 *   bridge -> page   : { source: "cdc-bridge", type: "config" | "stored" }
 *
 * Storage shape (chrome.storage.local), keyed by the map's file name — the map
 * file has no dependable name of its own, see mapFacts() in companion.js:
 *   maps:    { "<map key>": { name, thumb, thumbFixed, facts, seen } }
 *            `thumbFixed` is the same picture with the start positions marked,
 *            and exists only for the maps whose own preview marks none.
 *   renders: { "<map key>": { thumb: dataUrl, at: epochMs, v: rendererVersion } }
 *   full:<map key>: dataUrl                    // one item per map, megabytes
 *   guides:  { "<map key>": "free-form multi-line guide" }
 *   keys:    { overlay: {...}, debug: {...} }   // hotkey descriptors
 *   builds:  { "<side>": [ { name: "GAPOWR", key: {...} }, … ] }
 *            The build hotkeys, one profile per side, in the order the options
 *            page lists them. A separate item from `keys` rather than a branch
 *            inside it: `keys` is a flat map of name -> one descriptor, and both
 *            halves of the extension iterate it as one — a nested profile in
 *            there would be read as a hotkey with no `code`.
 *   chords:  { "<side>": { "<section>": { "<slot>": id | [id, id] | null } } }
 *            The user's chord **overrides**, slot index to object, laid over the
 *            layouts src/build-chords.js ships. A slot that is absent follows
 *            what ships; one stored as null is a key the user emptied on
 *            purpose. An array of ids is one key holding a country's several
 *            names for a thing. Separate from `builds` because it is keyed by
 *            position, not a list of key descriptors.
 *            Before 0.55.1 this held whole sections as arrays, which froze a
 *            layout against later fixes; those are dropped on load.
 *   roster:  { version, at, items: [ { name, type, sides: ["Allied"] }, … ] }
 *            What the client says can be built, harvested in the game tab from
 *            its own rules (companion.js sendRoster) because the options page
 *            has no game and therefore no rules. Names and costs are not in it —
 *            `replayTypes` below carries both for every object here, and the
 *            options page already loads that for the replay views.
 *   cameos:  { version, at, cols, cell: {width, height}, size: {width, height},
 *              sheet: "data:image/png;base64,…", index: { "GAPOWR": 0, … },
 *              pictures, ids, objects, missing: [ … ] }
 *            The sidebar picture for every object the client's art names, drawn
 *            in the game tab from the client's own SHPs and cameo.pal
 *            (hq-preview.js cameos). This is the only source of a sheet: it
 *            lands on window.__cdcCameos, which is the global the committed
 *            src/cameos.js used to publish before it was deleted — its 190 KB of
 *            artwork came out of a retail Red Alert 2 install, which no licence
 *            this repo can adopt covers. The shape was kept so every reader of
 *            the sheet went on working unchanged.
 *            `index` maps an id to a cell, and several ids share a cell where
 *            the game shares a picture. The counts after it are the harvest's
 *            own bookkeeping, not part of the drawing contract.
 *   cameoVersion: "0.83.3/1" — the client's version and the harvester's, joined.
 *            Apart from `cameos` on purpose: this is what a config push carries
 *            so a tab can answer "is the stored sheet still current" without
 *            reading a quarter of a megabyte of pixels to look at a string.
 *            Written in the same set as `cameos`, so it never claims a sheet
 *            that is not there.
 *   replayTypes: { version, at, types: { building: [ [name, label, cost, extra?],
 *              … ], infantry: […], vehicle: […], aircraft: […] },
 *              general: { maximumQueuedObjects, buildSpeed, multipleFactory,
 *              padAircraft: […] }, objects, named, … }
 *            The table a replay is written in, harvested in the game tab from
 *            the client's own four ordinal maps (hq-preview.js objectTypes).
 *            **The index of a row is the object id a replay names** — that is
 *            the whole contract, and the harvest fails rather than store a list
 *            with a hole in it. It lands on window.__cdcReplayTypes and
 *            window.__cdcReplayRules — the globals the committed
 *            src/replay-types.js used to publish before it was deleted, it
 *            having been generated from a retail Red Alert 2 install. The shape
 *            was kept so every reader decodes unchanged. The counts after
 *            `general` are the harvest's own bookkeeping, not part of the
 *            reading contract.
 *   replayTypesVersion: "0.83.3/1" — on exactly the terms of `cameoVersion`
 *            above, and written in the same set as `replayTypes`.
 *   prefs:   { preferHqPreview: bool, autoRender: bool, fullIcons: bool,
 *              captureSample: bool, chordSinglePress: bool, grabTabKeys: bool,
 *              fullscreenOnEnter: bool, menuOffEscape: bool,
 *              sidebarKeys: bool,
 *              cardPreferHq: bool, viewerIcons: bool }
 *            The first three are what the game draws — the loading-screen panel
 *            and the overlay; the two after captureSample are what the chord
 *            keys do, one of which takes a browser keyboard lock and so has to
 *            reach a match already in play. The last two are the options page's
 *            own cards and viewer, and are never read here: one setting used to
 *            answer for both, so a box in a ladder tab's list bar changed the
 *            overlay without saying so. One item, because the page writes them
 *            together.
 *   previewSrc: { "<map key>": "ours" | "original" }  // per-map, beats prefs
 *   spawnFix: { "<map key>": false }   // per-map, only the ones opted out
 *   spriteFix: { "<sprite type>": { x, y } }   // the offsets editor's save,
 *            over hq-preview.js's shipped SPRITE_FIX; the render reads it
 *   spriteFixByName: { "<object name>": { x, y } }  // the same, for one object
 *            rather than a whole type — e.g. CAAIRP, the airport
 *   align:   { key, name, width, height, fix, layers: ["base", …], at }
 *   settings: { at, requested: "read" | "write" | false, want, payload,
 *              done, ok, error, data, report, previous }
 *            One settings backup job — the request and its answer in one
 *            item, on the same terms as `bulk`. Only the game tab can read
 *            or write the client's own hotkey file and preferences, and only
 *            the options page can offer the user a file; this is what they
 *            say to each other. Nothing of the extension's own settings goes
 *            through here — the options page holds those already.
 *   align:<layer>: dataUrl                     // one item per layer, megabytes
 *
 * The full-size render lives in an item of its own, not in `renders`, because a
 * storage item is written whole: with thirty 3000px renders in one object,
 * every new map would rewrite a couple of hundred megabytes. The index keeps
 * only the small thumbnail, which is all the catalogue draws — the big one is
 * read when something actually opens it. That is also why the manifest asks for
 * "unlimitedStorage", and why there is a cap at all.
