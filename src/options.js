/**
 * Options page: four tabs — one per ranked ladder, the hotkeys, and the sprite
 * alignment instrument.
 *
 * A ladder tab is the whole instrument for one pool: sample it off the ladder,
 * tick what you want, render the ticked maps, and edit the guides of the maps
 * that ladder plays. The two are the same panel pointed at different pools, so
 * they are built from one template rather than written out twice.
 *
 * The catalogue is written by src/bridge.js as maps are parsed in game; this
 * page only reads it. Guides and hotkeys are written back, and the bridge
 * pushes them into a running game through storage.onChanged — no reload.

   * The file is JSON on purpose rather than the client's own INI: it holds four
