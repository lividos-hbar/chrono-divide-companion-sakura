# chrono-divide-companion

A Chromium (Chrome/Edge) MV3 extension that adds pre-game information to the
[Chrono Divide](https://game.chronodivide.com/) loading screen:

- **Faction labels** next to every player — the country name in text, instead of a flag you have to recognise.
- **Hints** — derived from the map (start positions, size, theater) plus your own per-map notes, edited in the options page.
- **Map preview** — our own render of the map where there is one, the map's baked-in thumbnail otherwise, shown during loading (the client already renders a preview in the lobby; the loading screen does not).
- **In-game overlay** on `1` — the same roster, map facts and hint, with the preview over the radar.
- **Build hotkeys** — a key that queues one of something, which the game has none of. One press is one
  cameo click; placement stays yours.
- **Build chords** — press a sidebar-tab key twice quickly (or once, by preference) and that tab opens
  as a grid of cameos under the cursor, laid out like the `qwert`/`asdfg`/`zxcvb` block itself. The next
  key orders that slot. Only what you can order right now is drawn. Every tile carries what its queue
  holds — how many are ordered, and how far the one being built has got — and a right click on one
  pauses or cancels it.
- **Cancel keys** — `Alt` and a sidebar-tab key pauses what that tab is building and cancels it on the
  second press, without opening anything; `Alt+Shift` cancels five. Alt is the cancel everywhere:
  on a slot of an open grid it is that slot instead.
- **Queue next** — `Ctrl` on a build key or a grid slot puts the order **behind what is being built**
  rather than at the back of the queue. It is the game's own Ctrl+click on a cameo, which the game
  gives no key of its own. `Ctrl+W` and `Ctrl+T` are the browser's, so holding them takes a keyboard
  lock, which is a setting.
- **Superweapon keys** — once you own a superweapon, its building's key aims it instead of ordering
  another building that would grant nothing. The two paradrops have keys of their own. Aiming is the
  client's own targeting mode: you still click the target.
- **Production panel** on `2` — all six queues at once, including the empty ones, which the sidebar
  cannot show because it only ever draws the tab you are looking at.
- **The game's menu off Escape**, onto `5` — in a match Escape is the game's own key for the menu
  whose third button is *Abort Mission*, which is a reflex and a click away from quitting. It now
  opens on a key you pressed on purpose, and Escape closes it instead — which the game itself binds
  no key to at all.
- **Net readout** on `7` — ping, how long your own orders take to come back, frames a second, the
  lockstep's turn length and every player's ping. The client draws these as graphs on `Ctrl+R`; this
  reads the same sources and writes them as text, including the two it computes and never shows.
- **No waiting on the lockstep.** The game applies an order a few network turns after the press, and
  the overlay used to *read* the queue to decide what the next press meant — so a second press inside
  that window decided against a state it had already changed, and a cancel could come out as a second
  pause. The overlay now keeps its own copy of what it has ordered, so the keys and the tiles both see
  the queue as it will be. One press is still one action.

- **Player colours** — who is painted what, whatever they picked in the lobby: you, your
  allies, and each opponent in turn. The game repaints itself — units, buildings, radar
  blips, health bars — and nothing is sent to anyone else.

- **Settings backup** — the game keeps its hotkeys in a file inside the
  browser's own private storage and its other options in that browser's
  localStorage, so a second browser starts blank and there is nothing on disk to
  copy. One file carries both, next to the extension's own bindings.

## Why an extension and not a CD mod

The official [mod SDK](https://github.com/chronodivide/mod-sdk) covers `rules.ini`,
`art.ini`, maps, the splash PNG and the menu video. It explicitly **cannot**
change UI/HTML/CSS and cannot ship scripts. Everything here is UI, so it lives
browser-side.

This is an unofficial, client-only extension. Most of it is an overlay: it
renders extra information from state the client already holds, and adds nothing
to what the client sends.

**Build hotkeys and chords are the exception, and they are worth stating
plainly.** A bound key pushes a queue order into the client's own action queue —
the same order, serialised the same way, that clicking the cameo sends. So the
extension does reach gameplay at that one point: it gives the sidebar a
keyboard, which RA2 and Chrono Divide never had. A chord is the same press
reached through two keys instead of one, and Shift on a unit is the client's own
five — the quantity a shift-click has always sent. It does not decide what to build, place anything, read
anything the game hides from you, or act while you are not pressing a key. What
that is worth on a ladder whose [rules](https://chronodivide.com/ladder-rules.html)
ban "any kind of cheats" without naming third-party tools either way is a
judgement the person installing it makes; the extension states what it does
rather than deciding for them.

## How it hooks in

The CD client is a React DOM UI on top of a three.js canvas, loaded through
SystemJS with **named internal modules** (`gui/screen/game/loadingScreen/LoadingScreen`,
`game/map/MapFile`, …). Two consequences:

1. The loading screen is real DOM (`.loading-screen`, `.player-status`,
   `.player-country-icon`, `.map-name`) — injectable and observable.
2. `System.import("<module name>")` reaches the client's own classes, so the
   extension reuses the client's decoders instead of reimplementing them.

Both require page-world access, so the content script is declared
`"world": "MAIN"`. Everything the extension knows about the client's internals
was read out of its own bundle at v0.83.3, and the module names and call shapes
are quoted in the source files that use them.

### Player-colour renderer investigation

The extension does not yet alter player colours. In a live game, run the single
command `__cdcPlayerColours.inspect()`. It prints a compact, copyable table
with one row per prototype method from the palette, minimap model/renderer,
SHP builders/materials, and the unit renderables. This replaces the old broad
inventory whose useful method names were collapsed into `Array(n)` in DevTools.
If a row needs a deeper look, run
`__cdcPlayerColours.show(id, exportName, method)` with that row's values to
print its complete body. These commands only inspect the loaded module table
and do not patch game prototypes or modify game state.

For an opt-in local display override, run
`__cdcPlayerColours.setEnemyColor("DarkRed")` before starting a match (or while
one is running). The value must be the name of a colour in `game.rules.colors`;
the client precomputes batched voxel palettes only for those colours, so passing
a newly-created RGB colour is deliberately unsupported. `setEnabled(false)`
restores the players' original local colour objects. It does not send an action
or alter the lockstep state. Enable it before match start for an immediately
consistent minimap; changing it mid-match can leave existing radar blips at
their previous colour until the relevant units or structures next dirty a tile.

## Install (development)

1. `chrome://extensions` → enable **Developer mode**.
2. **Load unpacked** → select this repo's root (or `dist/<name>-<version>/`, which is what the stores get — see **Packaging for the stores**).
3. Open <https://game.chronodivide.com/> and start a game.

## Packaging for the stores

```
node scripts/gen-icon.mjs     # icons/icon-{16,32,48,128}.png + store/logo-300.png
node scripts/pack.mjs         # dist/<name>-<version>/ + dist/<name>-<version>.zip
```

Upload the zip. `dist/<name>-<version>/` is the same file list unpacked, so
**Load unpacked** on it tests exactly what the store gets rather than what the
repo happens to contain.

**The package is an allowlist** — `manifest.json`, `src/`, `icons/`, nothing
else. The extension's root is the repository's root, so a `zip -r .` here would
ship the whole working repository — notes, records, generator inputs, everything
that is not the extension — into a public listing; that is a disclosure rather
than a size problem, and no `.gitignore` rule catches it because those files are
tracked on purpose.

Three guards fail the build rather than warn:

| guard | what it catches |
|---|---|
| manifest sweep | a path the manifest names that is not in the package — `load unpacked` substitutes a placeholder icon, the store rejects the upload |
| link sweep | a `src`/`href` on the options page that does not resolve, or that is absolute |
| leak sweep | a Windows user directory, `AppData`, the operator's user name, an email, an extension id, a `Program Files` path — the same list the site build sweeps its own output for |

`--dry` runs all three and writes nothing; `--force` overwrites a build of a
version already packaged, which is otherwise refused because neither store lets
a version be re-uploaded.

The icon is one SVG in `scripts/gen-icon.mjs`, rendered at each size rather than
drawn large and downscaled — a 2px stroke downscaled to 16px is grey fog.
`--check` re-renders to a temp directory and diffs, so a committed PNG that no
longer matches the shape is a failure rather than a surprise.

**Still owed to the listings, and not automatable here:** screenshots, the
per-permission justifications, the single-purpose statement, and the data-usage
disclosure (the extension stores everything in `chrome.storage.local` and
transmits nothing, but the form is mandatory either way).

## In-game overlay

**`1`** toggles an overlay during the match: the map preview sits on top of the
client's radar, and a two-row bar at the top carries the roster on the left
(each player on his own line — you / ally / opp, name, faction, in their player
colour) with the map facts over the current hint on the right.

The you/ally/opp marks appear only when the local player can be identified with
certainty (`countryName` matches exactly one player). When two players picked
the same country the marks are dropped rather than guessed — the names and
factions still read fine without them.

## Build hotkeys

The client's own `KeyCommandType` has no build command — the sidebar is mouse
only — so a key that queues something is the one thing here the game cannot
already do. Bind them under **Settings** → *Build hotkeys*: pick an
object, press a combination, and in a match that key queues one of it. Placement
is untouched; a building still waits for you to click a tile.

Bindings are **per side**, because the sides do not build the same things, and
the panel offers what the client says that side can build. A key bound to
something your country cannot build — a Tesla Tank on a non-Russian Soviet — does
nothing and says so over the game rather than silently doing something else. The
same line appears when the prerequisites are not up yet, which is a different
message on purpose: one means *fix the binding*, the other means *build a
barracks first*.

Nothing about RA2's build rules is reimplemented here. A press asks the client
three questions and obeys the answers:

| Question | Asked of |
|---|---|
| may this be built right now | `production.getAvailableObjects()` — tech level, build limit, factory, prerequisites |
| which queue does it go in | `production.getQueueTypeForObject()` — Armory rather than Structures for a defence, Ships rather than Vehicles for a hovercraft |
| does the order stand | `UpdateQueueAction#process`, which re-checks availability on every client as it runs |

That last one is why this cannot desync a match: the action is the one the mouse
produces, so every client processes it identically, and an order that should not
have been accepted is dropped everywhere at once.

**`Ctrl` on a build key queues it next** (0.70.0) — behind whatever the queue is
paying for, rather than at the back of it. See *Queue next* below; it is the same
modifier on the chord grid, and the same client action either way. A binding that
*includes* Ctrl still wins on its own key: the bare binding is only reached for
when nothing is bound to the press as it came.

**Most build keys will be bare letters, and the client uses most of those.** The
extension takes the press first and swallows it, so a binding overrides the game
command on that key. That is a choice, not an accident: `__cdc.build()` in the
console lists the bindings and says which of them override a game command — run
it once after binding a profile.

## The lag, and why a press does not wait for it

Chrono Divide is lockstep. A press does not change anything: `pushAction` puts
the order on the same `actionQueue` the mouse feeds, the turn manager sends it,
and `UpdateQueueAction#process` carries it out some network turns later — on
every client, at the same tick. Until then the local queue reads exactly as it
did before the press.

That is invisible for a mouse, because a click is decided by a player looking at
the sidebar. It is not invisible for a key, because **the overlay decides by
reading the queue** — pause or cancel, order or place, how many fit. Inside the
window it was deciding against a state it had already changed:

| press | what the client said | what was sent | what was meant |
|---|---|---|---|
| cancel key, 1st | building, at the head | pause | pause |
| cancel key, 2nd, before the turn | building, at the head — *unchanged* | pause, again | cancel |

So the cancel never went, and from the outside it looked swallowed. The same
class of thing on the other keys: fast presses queueing past the room the queue
had, and a key pressed on a queue that had just turned ready ordering a second
building instead of placing the finished one.

**Since 0.68.0 the overlay keeps its own copy.** Every action it pushes goes into
a ledger and is laid over the client's reading, so a decision and a tile both see
the queue as it *will* be. One press is still exactly one action — nothing is
held back or batched, and the first press leaves as fast as it ever did.

The ledger retires an action when the client's own state moves to what it
predicted, which is as soon as the turn carrying it runs. Two things it
deliberately does not do:

- **It does not cry foul when the queue moves on its own.** A unit leaving the
  factory while an order is in flight is routine, not a refusal; the reading
  becomes the new starting point and the prediction goes on top of it.
- **It does not guess about a refusal.** `UpdateQueueAction#process` re-checks
  availability as it runs, so an order that stopped being legal between the press
  and the turn is dropped in **silence** — nothing will ever say so. An action
  that has neither landed nor become moot inside a second and a bit is called
  lost, the tile snaps back to the truth, and the overlay says which of the
  order, the cancel or the hold went missing. Late and right, rather than early
  and sometimes wrong.

`__cdc.build().prediction` reports what the wait actually measured this session
— `lastMs` and `worstMs` are how long a pushed action waited before the client
showed it. The deadline in `src/queue-predict.js` is a backstop picked without a
measurement, and that is where the measurement to replace it comes from.

`src/queue-predict.js` holds the whole of it with no client in it, so
`node scripts/check-predict.mjs` exercises the reconciliation on snapshots
written by hand — including the two-press pair above, which fails that check
without the ledger.

## Build chords

The flat table above binds one key to one object, which runs out of keys. The
chords use the ones the game already spent.

The client *does* have keys for the four sidebar tabs — `StructureTab`,
`DefenseTab`, `InfantryTab`, `UnitTab`, on `q`/`w`/`e`/`r` unless you have
rebound them. **Press one twice quickly** and that tab opens as a grid under the
cursor, laid out like the keys themselves:

```
q w e r t
a s d f g      the block the grid draws, and the keys that pick from it
z x c v b
```

So `qq` is *buildings*, and `qqq` is a power plant, `qqw` a barracks, `qqe` a
refinery. **Shift** orders five of a unit — the client's own shift-click
quantity — **holding** a slot key fills its queue, **Alt** on a slot cancels
what that slot is building, **Ctrl** on a slot orders it *next*, and `Esc` or a
click anywhere outside closes the grid. Ctrl closed it until 0.70.0 and no longer
does: the modifier was worth more than the second way out.
A buildings grid closes itself after an order, since that queue holds one item
anyway; a units grid stays open so the next order is one key. And when the
building on a grid you are watching **finishes**, the tab key that opened it
places it, rather than ordering the slot it sits on — the rule below.

**One press, if you would rather.** *Settings* → *Build chords* has a
tick that opens the grid on the first press instead of the second. Nothing else
changes: the press still reaches the client, the tab still switches, and the grid
is simply in the way of the next key — which is the point of it, and why the
double tap is still the default.

**The first press is still the game's.** It is not swallowed and not delayed: the
client switches the tab exactly as it always did, and the extension only notices
that it happened. That is also why the prefix is read from the client's live
binding table rather than hardcoded — rebind your tabs and the chords move with
them, and the grid can never open on a different tab from the one the first
press just selected.

**What cannot be ordered is dimmed, not hidden** (0.71.0). The grid drew only
what a press would order from 0.59.0, and the cost was that its shape changed
under the hand between two openings — and that the one question a greyed tile
answers, *the key is right, so what is the thing waiting on?*, could not be asked
at all. So a key waiting on a battle lab, an Ore Purifier already standing, and a
superweapon halfway through its charge are all drawn, dimmed on the picture and
the name while the key badge and the countdown stay readable. Pressing one says
what it is waiting on rather than doing nothing.

A cell goes blank only for what this country can **never** have: a slot none of
whose ids it builds — a German Tank Destroyer on a Korean grid — and a paradrop
whose building nobody has, since the picture for those comes off the weapon
itself. Blank keys still keep their cell, because the grid's geometry *is* the
keyboard's and a hole that closed up would move every key after it; a trailing
row with nothing in it is dropped instead.

**Every tile says what the queues say about it.** A `×N` in the corner is how
many are ordered, and the one at the head of its queue carries a bar and a
percentage — the same numbers the sidebar draws on the cameo it is showing you,
for all fifteen keys at once. A tile with nowhere to go greys out: the queue is
at its size, or that object is at its per-type cap of 30. All of it is painted
off the client's own `onQueueUpdate`, which fires on every tick that spends
credits, so the bar moves with the build and **stops dead when the money runs
out** — a queue that has stalled looks different from one that is slow.

**Right-click a tile to pause or cancel it**, which is what right-clicking a
cameo has always done and the grid did not have until 0.58.0:

| the tile | right click | Shift + right click |
|---|---|---|
| what is being built now | **pauses** the queue — pause belongs to the queue, so pausing a Grizzly pauses the war factory | the same; pause has no quantity |
| something behind it in the queue | **cancels one** | cancels **all** of that object |
| nothing of it queued | says so | — |

Left click still resumes a paused item, because that is the client's own rule.
The money comes back only when the last of an object leaves the queue —
cancelling one of three refunds nothing — and that is the client's arithmetic,
not ours.

**A superweapon's key aims it, once you have one** (0.60.0). `wwd` orders a
Chronosphere until one is standing; after that the same key hands it to the
client's targeting mode, and the tile shows the charge where a queue's progress
would be — a countdown, then `ready` in green, or `no power` if the base has
browned out and the clock has stopped. Ordering a *second* Chronosphere is not on
that key any more, and losing that is the point rather than a cost: the client
adds a superweapon to a player once (`!has(name)`), so a second building grants
nothing but a spare. The sidebar still sells one if you want it.

**Which keys change meaning is the game's decision.** A superweapon section with
`ShowTimer=yes` — the Nuke, the Iron Curtain, the Chronosphere, the Weather
Controller — takes its building's key. `ShowTimer=no` does not, and that is why
`qqt` goes on building airfields for an American: their Airforce Command grants
`AmericanParaDropSpecial` as a side effect, and you build several of them for the
planes.

**So the two paradrops get keys of their own**, and they are the only things on
the grid that are not objects:

| key | what | who has it |
|---|---|---|
| `wwt`, Allied | **American paradrop**, sharing the Grand Cannon's key as a deck | America. The other half is French, so the key is dead for neither and no third country loses anything |
| `wwg`, both sides | **Airport paradrop**, off a captured tech airport | anyone who captures one — the same key on both grids, like the shipyard's, for the thing a match may never hand you |

A key like that is drawn only while you actually hold the weapon — the one place
the 0.71.0 rule above does not reach, and for two reasons that point the same
way: a paradrop you have no building for is *never* rather than *not yet* for
three of the five countries, and its picture is read off the weapon, so there
would be nothing to dim. Once you hold it, it dims like anything else until it is
charged. In the options page they are a *Superweapons* group in the picker, each
named after the building it comes from.

**Aiming is not firing.** `activateSpecialMode` enters `SpecialActionMode`: it
plays the client's own `EVA_SelectTarget`, swaps the cursor to the weapon's, and
the `ActivateSuperWeapon` action is pushed by **the click that follows**. The
Chronosphere is two clicks, because its rules say `PreClick=yes` and the second
half is a separate weapon (`ChronoWarpSpecial`). Nothing here decides *where* a
superweapon lands — the same statement the rest of this extension makes about
placement. It is also why an activation closes the grid: the box takes the mouse,
and the next thing you do is click the map.

**`Ctrl` and a tab key is that same right click, without opening anything**
(0.59.0). It acts on what the tab is building — the item the queue is paying for
— and it is the sidebar's own rule, not a new one:

| the press | what happens |
|---|---|
| **Alt+Q · W · E · R** on a running queue | **pauses** it — pause belongs to the queue, so this is the war factory, not the Grizzly |
| the same press again | **cancels one** of what it paused |
| on a *finished* building | **cancels it** at once: a ready queue has nothing left to pause |
| **Alt+Shift** + one of them | cancels **five**, and sends the pause first if you had not already — you asked for five gone, not for a queue on hold |
| nothing queued on that tab | says so, and does nothing |

The Units tab feeds three queues — Vehicles, Ships and Aircraft — so the press
takes the one that is actively building, and failing that the first that holds
anything.

**Corrected in 0.68.0.** That rule alone was said to be "how the second press
still finds the queue the first one paused", and it is only that on a tab with
one queue running. With two war factories' worth of work on the Units tab, the
pause left Vehicles no longer *active*, so the second press moved on to Ships and
paused that instead — the pair came apart, and the thing you meant to cancel was
never cancelled. The queue a cancel key last acted on now wins for as long as it
still holds something, which is the sidebar's own behaviour: a right click is a
click on one cameo, and pausing, wandering off and cancelling reaches the same
queue however long the gap. Reading the queues through the prediction is what
brought it into the open — before that the second press saw an unchanged,
still-active queue and landed on the right one by accident.

**Alt on a slot key is that tile's right click** (0.62.0). The same pause-then-
cancel the tab key sends, aimed at the key you name rather than at whatever the
queue happens to be paying for — so a Grizzly three deep in the war factory is
`rr` then `Alt+w`, without hunting for the cameo. It follows the **key** rule
rather than the mouse one: the first press pauses a running queue and the second
cancels, because that is what `Alt`+tab already does and two cancel keys that
disagreed about the first press would be two rules to remember. `Alt+Shift` is
five. Alt on a key the grid does not have is still the game's, and the grid
closes as it always did.

**A held key means all of it** (0.62.0). Keep a slot key down for about half a
second and the queue **fills** — to the room it has left, which is the client's
own clamp; keep `Alt`+slot down and the whole of that item is **cancelled**. The
tap is not delayed to find out: one is ordered (or the pause is sent) the instant
the key goes down, and the hold adds the rest on top. Letting go before the half
second leaves you exactly where the tap left you, and losing the window while
holding — Alt+Tab — drops the hold rather than firing it late.

**Ctrl orders it next** (0.70.0). The one thing a cameo can do that no key could:
the client's `UpdateType.AddNext`, which the sidebar has had since its own v0.79
and which its `KeyCommandType` never got a command for. `Ctrl` on a slot, on a
tile's own key, or on any of the flat build keys puts the order **behind what is
being built** rather than at the back of the queue.

"Next" is literal rather than "first", and the shape is worth knowing because it
is what the grid then draws. `ProductionQueue#insertAfterFirst` cuts the head
entry to one, puts yours in behind it, and re-pushes the rest of the head entry
behind that:

| before | press | after |
|---|---|---|
| `Rhino ×5`, 40% built | `Ctrl` on the Grizzly | `Rhino ×1` still 40% built, `Grizzly ×1`, `Rhino ×4` |
| `Rhino ×5` | `Ctrl` on the Rhino | `Rhino ×1`, `Rhino ×1`, `Rhino ×3` — entries are not merged |
| empty queue | `Ctrl` on anything | the same as no Ctrl at all |

So the unit you were half way through keeps its progress and its place, and
nothing is refunded or restarted. `Ctrl+Shift` inserts five and `Ctrl` **held**
fills the queue behind the head. It does nothing on the two building tabs, whose
queues hold one item — there is never a second thing to jump.

The prediction models the split exactly, entries and order included
(`src/queue-predict.js`, and `node scripts/check-predict.mjs` has a row per
shape). It has to: the ledger recognises its own action by the item list, so an
algebra that merged the entries or inserted at the front would read every
next-order as the client contradicting it and report a landed order as lost.

So the whole scale on one hand: **tap** is one, **Shift** is five, **hold** is
everything; and **Alt** turns any of the three from an order into a cancel.

**Our own keys are off that block, on the left hand, and bare** (0.63.0, then
0.66.0). Every one of them is a digit — `1` the overlay, `2` the production
panel, `3` and `4` the two preview keys, `5` the game's own menu, `7` the net
readout — and every part of that is a constraint rather than a taste.

*Off the block*, because an open grid spends every modifier on those fifteen
letters: bare orders, Shift orders five, Alt cancels, and Ctrl closes on any key
at all. Every default that sat there stopped working while a grid was up —
Alt+Q, Alt+G and Alt+B outright, Shift+B and Shift+F for as long as the grid was
on screen. `scripts/check-chords.mjs` now refuses a fixed hotkey on a slot key
or on Ctrl, with no exceptions left to grandfather.

*On the left hand*, because the right one is on the mouse. On a split keyboard —
the 6×4-plus-thumbs the author plays — the left half is `Esc 1…5`, `Tab qwert`,
`Shift asdfg`, `Ctrl zxcvb`, which is the whole of the chord feature already; the
digits are what is left of that half once the block is out. 0.62.0 briefly put
three of them on Shift+O/I/P, which is the *other* half and reachable only by
letting go of the mouse.

*Bare*, because on that keyboard the digits live on a **layer**: `Alt+1` is three
keys — layer, Alt, digit — where `1` is two. **This one is a trade, and it is the
game's team select that pays.** A key with no modifier is taken from the client
first and never reaches the match, so with the shipped defaults, selecting groups
1–5 does not work until you rebind either side. What it does *not* cost is the
modified press: `matchesHotkey` compares the whole modifier state rather than
ignoring extras, so **`Ctrl`+digit still assigns a group**, and `Shift`+digit and
`Alt`+digit still reach the game as well.

If that trade is not yours to make, the options page is where to undo it, and
every one of these rows carries the mark that says what a bare key costs.

**A key you rebound yourself is left alone** — only the shipped defaults moved,
and the options page now marks a binding that lands on the block or on Ctrl as
shadowed, so a rebind that would be eaten says so before you play with it.

**The game's own fullscreen key moves to Alt+Enter** (0.64.0). `Alt+F` is what
the client binds fullscreen to — its menu says so *where an exit would be*, since
on a page there is nothing to exit to and leaving is closing the tab. But `f` is
also the ninth slot of the grid, and Alt on a slot key is that slot's cancel, so
one press had two meanings. It is settled by position rather than by preference:

| when | Alt+F | Alt+Enter |
|---|---|---|
| a grid is open | cancels that slot — the grid takes the press first | fullscreen |
| no grid | nothing, the key has moved | fullscreen |
| the setting unticked | the client's own fullscreen, as it always was | nothing |

**Nothing here calls `requestFullscreen`.** What goes out is a synthetic `Alt+F`
at the document, and the client does all of it — including taking the keyboard
lock it takes when it enters *its own* fullscreen, which is the thing 0.60.1 is
about. Entering fullscreen ourselves would reproduce exactly the state that fixed:
fullscreen held by a caller that never asked for the lock, and Escape back to
leaving it instead of reaching the game.

The one thing a page cannot forge is `isTrusted`, so a client that checks it would
drop the re-issue in silence. That case is **reported**, not worked around: if
fullscreen has not changed 400 ms after the press, the log says the client may be
refusing a synthetic key. `__cdc.chords().fullscreenKey` says the other half —
whether `Alt+F` is in the client's own table at all, which is the one fact only a
running match can supply.

**The game's own menu moves off Escape, onto `5`** (0.73.0). In a match Escape is
the client's key for `KeyCommandType.Options`, which opens the in-game menu —
Options, Fullscreen, **Abort Mission**, Resume Mission. That is one reflex and one
click from quitting a match, on the key a hand reaches for to cancel a placement
or clear a selection.

| when | Escape | `5` |
|---|---|---|
| in a match, no menu | nothing — the key has moved | opens the menu |
| the menu is open | closes it, back to the match | closes it too |
| the menu is a screen deep (quit confirmation, options) | one step back | closes it |
| the full render is on screen | dismisses the render, as it always did | opens the menu |
| the setting unticked | the game's own menu, as it always was | nothing |

**The second half is not symmetry, it is a gap in the client.** Opening the menu
calls `WorldInteraction#setEnabled(false)`, which *removes the client's own
keydown listener* — so with the menu up no key reaches the game at all, Escape
included, and *Resume Mission* is a mouse click or nothing. Ours is the only
listener still standing, which is what makes closing it from the keyboard
possible in the first place.

**Nothing here forges a keypress.** The client's `GameMenu` instance is captured
off its own `init` — the same prototype hook `CombatantUi` gets — and `open()`,
`close()` and `controller.popScreen()` are called directly, so the events that
unlock the pointer and re-enable the world interaction are the client's own. That
is the difference from the fullscreen swap above, which has no method to call and
therefore carries a residual `isTrusted` risk this does not.

**Both halves stop the moment the match does** (0.73.1). A match ends with the
client disposing its player UI — which takes its own `keydown` listener with it —
and only leaving the game screen five seconds later, with the menu object still
alive in between. In that window the client's Escape is already dead and ours was
not, so the key could open the menu onto a screen the client had finished with:
the open event dispatched into a disposed world interaction, a screen was pushed
onto a HUD about to be destroyed, and *Abort Mission* there would have disposed
the player UI a second time. The key now answers only while a match is in play. A
menu that was already open when the match ended under it still closes.

**Which key is swallowed is read, not assumed.** The client's `KeyBinds` table is
already hooked, so the key it has on `Options` is the one taken — move it in the
game's own key settings and that move is respected, and Escape is left alone.
`__cdc.chords().menuKey` says what it found and whether the menu itself was
captured.

**Ctrl+W is the browser's, and holding it takes a keyboard lock.** The tab closes
without the page being asked, so `preventDefault` is not offered and `Ctrl` cannot
mean *queue next* on the grid's `w` and `t` slots on its own. What a fullscreen
game uses for this is `navigator.keyboard.lock()`, and so does this — for the
codes a Ctrl is actually taken on, in a match, and only while the game is in
**its own** fullscreen: the client's button, not F11, because the API is defined
against the Fullscreen API's element and F11 leaves it null. Without the lock the
press is **left alone entirely** rather than queued into a closing tab — you would
lose the order and the tab and see neither happen. It is a tick in *Overlay
settings*, and `__cdc.chords()` reports whether the lock is held.

**What it asks for moved in 0.70.0 and the reason did not.** It used to hold the
four sidebar tab keys, because the cancel key was Ctrl and one of the tabs is `w`.
The cancel is on Alt now, which the browser does not reserve — but Ctrl became
*queue next* across the whole grid, whose second and fifth slots are `w` and `t`.
Same two codes, opposite command, and `ctrlKeysToHold()` derives them from the
keys a Ctrl is taken on rather than naming them, so a fixed binding on `n` is
held too.

**There is one lock per page, and the client is already using it** — the
correction 0.60.1 is, and the reason that setting broke on the first Escape in
0.59.0. `keyboard.lock(codes)` **replaces** the locked set rather than adding to
it, and the client locks `Escape, F5, F12, F11` whenever it enters fullscreen,
precisely so that Escape reaches the game instead of leaving fullscreen. Asking
for four tab keys released exactly that: the next Escape dropped out of
fullscreen, **leaving fullscreen ends the lock altogether**, and Ctrl+W went back
to closing the tab. So neither side calls the API directly any more — the
extension wraps it, records what each side asked for, and locks the **union**, so
the client keeps its Escape and we get our Ctrl+W. Turning the setting off adds
nothing and takes nothing: the client's own lock is left exactly as it was, and
what you give up is *next* on two of the fifteen slots.

**A structures chord opens while that queue is building**, which it did not
before 0.58.0. The old rule was that a building queue holds one item, so there
was nothing to add and nothing to cancel; the second half stopped being true
when tiles gained a right click, and the grid is now where you watch a
construction yard and where you stop it. Finished is still different: `qq` hands
the building to the client's placement mode, which is what clicking the ready
cameo does.

**And the tab key keeps that meaning under an open grid** (0.61.0). Watch a
construction yard on the grid you opened while it was building and the building
finishes *under* it — from that moment the queue takes nothing else until the
structure is on the ground, so every slot on the grid would be refused. So `q`
places what `qq` would have placed, `w` does the same for the defence queue, the
grid closes on the way out because the next thing you do is click the map, and
the hint line under the title says `q places` the moment it becomes true. Shift
is untouched: it still means five of that slot, which a ready queue has no room
for either. The two unit tabs never see any of this — a unit queue is never
ready, its units leave the factory on their own.

**The grid is driven by the game's cursor, not the browser's.** The client keeps
the real pointer *locked* — the cursor you see in a match is a sprite it draws,
not the OS one — and under a lock the browser reports the cursor as frozen
wherever it was when the lock took, and its own hit-testing cannot reach an
overlay at all. Releasing the lock is not the answer: leaving one drops the OS
cursor in the middle of the screen, away from the grid. So the lock is left
alone and the grid does the three things the browser would have done — finding
the tile under the cursor, lighting it up, and **drawing the cursor itself** —
against the cursor you can actually see. Clicks work the same in fullscreen,
because nothing about this depends on the window.

The third of those is 0.59.0. The client's cursor is a sprite in its own canvas
and our boxes are DOM above that canvas, so an overlay covered the only cursor in
the window and you aimed at a tile by dead reckoning. There is one drawn over our
own boxes now — over those and nowhere else, since anywhere else the game's own
cursor is right there and a second one would be two cursors disagreeing. The
production panel gets it too.

**An open grid outranks the fixed hotkeys**, and since 0.63.0 there is nothing
left for that to cost: every fixed key is `Alt`+a digit and the grid's block is
fifteen letters. The rule still stands for anything *you* bind there — a slot
key under any modifier, or any Ctrl press, goes to the grid while one is open,
and the options page marks such a binding.

**Which grid a building is on is the game's decision, not a preference.**
`BuildCat=Combat` sends a building to the Armory queue, which is the Defence tab
— so the superweapons, the Gap Generator, the SpySat Uplink and the Psychic
Sensor are on `ww`, not `qq`, however much they read like base buildings. They
were on the wrong grid in 0.54.0; `scripts/check-chords.mjs` now reads
`BuildCat` out of the generated rules table and refuses a layout that disagrees
with the client.

**One key can hold a country's two names for one thing, and you never see it.**
`AMRADR`'s rules section is literally `Name:GAAIRC` — the American Airforce
Command is not a different building, it is the one an American player gets — and
a Korean player's Black Eagle is everyone else's Intruder. Giving each its own
key would be a key dead for every country but one, so the slot holds both ids
and the *match* decides. Since every country on the side gets one of them, there
is nothing here for you to know: the key is the Airforce Command Headquarters,
or the Intruder, under its plain name and its own picture, in the editor as in
the game. The pair behind it is machinery.

**Both sides are the grids their player arrived at.** The Soviet one shipped in
0.56.0 and the Allied one in 0.57.0, each adopted from a profile that had been
pressing it for a season — which outranks the two rules the layouts were built
on before that, tech order and then the mirror, because it is the only one with
evidence behind it. What is left of the mirror still holds where the rosters do
the same jobs: the structures opening, `q` the miner and `w` the main tank and
`e` the anti-air on units, the country key, the sea. And it is broken where the
hand disagreed with it — the units grids swap `t` and `d` against each other,
the Allied `t` being the plane and the Soviet `t` the artillery.

The rows are the grouping. **`qwert` is what you build every match**: power /
barracks / refinery / war factory then radar on structures, the turrets and the
wall on defence. **`asdfg` is the late and the expensive** — battle lab,
superweapons, MCV, heavy tank, the heroes — and `g` ends the section, which is
where the **shipyard** sits rather than at its tech level, being the one
building a land map makes pointless. **`zxcvb` on the units grid is the sea**:
all five keys, attack ship and transport and capital ship on the same three of
them. `scripts/check-chords.mjs` refuses a layout that floats something above
that row or parks something dry in it.

**Country units are on the key that ends their group** — `d` on the infantry
grid, after the specialists and before the heroes, and `f` on the units grid,
after the land block; the same key on both sides, so it is one key to learn per
section rather than one per grid. The Iraqi Desolator and the Cuban Terrorist
share it: most countries get neither, and giving each its own would be two keys
dead for almost everyone. The French Grand Cannon is the exception and barely
one — it is a turret, so it sits with the turrets.

In a match that key is whichever one *your* country builds, and **empty when
your country builds none of them** — a dimmed tile means "not yet", while a
German Tank Destroyer on a Korean grid is never. In the options page, which has
no country to resolve against, that one slot is drawn as a **hand of cards** —
both faces spread far enough to be read — because naming just the first would
state something false. This is the only kind of slot drawn that way: two ids
that are one object get one picture and one name, since there is no choice in
them to show.

The layouts ship filled in for both sides and are edited under **Overlay
settings** → *Build chords*: pick a side, a section, then a key, and the picker
under the grid says what is on it. Putting something on a key it already sits
somewhere else on **swaps the two** rather than leaving it in both places or
quietly emptying the old one. *Reset section* drops the override, so that section
follows what ships again.

### The keys on the game's own sidebar

A grid answers "which key builds this" once it is open. The sidebar answers it
without being asked: from 0.65.0 each cameo carries **the slot letter of its
chord** in the top-left corner, and each of the four tab buttons carries **its
own prefix key**. Read together they are the whole press — `r` on the Units tab,
`t` on a Rhino cameo, so the Rhino is `rr` then `t`.

The prefix is on the tab rather than on every cameo because it is one fact per
tab: a `qq` repeated down twelve tiles is twelve copies of something the tab
already says. Both badges sit in the same corner, and the tab's is the smaller of
the two — a tab button is a fifth the height of a cameo and its artwork is the
whole of it, so 0.65.0's centred badge covered the thing it was annotating.

A cameo the game has **greyed out** keeps its key, dimmed — the key is right, it
is the object that is not available yet — and a cameo nothing binds carries no
badge at all.

**They never take the mouse.** The badges are `pointer-events: none` to the last
box, which matters more here than anywhere else in the extension: this is the one
overlay sitting on top of something you have to be able to click.

**They follow the sidebar, including while you resize it.** The client draws the
whole HUD in WebGL, so there is no cameo element to attach to — the positions are
read from the client's own scene, every frame, and the DOM is written only when
one of them changes. That is what makes a mid-match scale change a non-event: the
client rebuilds its entire HUD on a viewport change (a resize, its fullscreen
button, a browser zoom), the sidebar gains or loses whole rows of cameos as the
window gets taller or shorter, and none of it is a case this has to detect. It is
just different numbers on the next frame.

**A superweapon key is two keys, and the badge follows it** (0.67.0). A slot
holding, say, the Chronosphere orders the building while there is none, and
*aims the weapon* once there is. The client draws those as two different cameos —
the building in its own tab, and the ability it adds to the Defence tab the
moment the weapon exists — so the badge moves with the meaning: on the building
until it is up, on the skill afterwards. A build limit greys the building's cameo
rather than removing it, which is why the badge has to be taken off it rather
than left to disappear on its own.

The **chord grid** does the same thing with the picture. A tile whose key has
stopped ordering draws the weapon's own icon instead of the building's, read
straight out of the running client — a superweapon is not an object, so its
picture is not in the extension's generated cameo sheet and cannot be. A client
that cannot answer leaves the building's cameo in place.

*Settings* → *Build chords* has a tick to turn them off.

## The production panel

**`2`** shows every production queue at once — Structures, Defence, Infantry,
Vehicles, Ships, Aircraft — with what is in each, how far the first item has got,
and whether it is ready or on hold. **A queue with nothing in it says so**, which
is the part the sidebar cannot do: it only ever draws the tab you are looking at,
so an idle war factory looks the same as a tab you have not opened.

It is live off the client's own `production.onQueueUpdate` rather than a timer,
so it costs nothing while nothing is being built, and it drags anywhere you want
it. An order you have just pressed is in it before the client has applied it,
which is the other half of the same fact: that event says nothing until the
client acts, and an **idle** queue spends no credits and so dispatches nothing at
all — the first order into an empty factory would otherwise be the one press that
still looked slow. See [The lag](#the-lag-and-why-a-press-does-not-wait-for-it).

**If a key does nothing, `__cdc.build()` in the game tab's console says why.** A
dead key has five possible causes — the client modules did not load, no match is
captured, the side did not resolve, the bindings never reached the tab, or the
press matches none of them — and every one of them looks identical from the
outside. It answers all five; `__cdc.build("KeyQ")` also says what that key is
bound to here and what the client itself has on it. Two of the five have already
happened: bindings that were stored and never pushed to a running tab (0.53.1),
and client modules that were imported and then not kept (0.53.3, now guarded by
`scripts/check-modules.mjs`).

**And `__cdc.chords()` is the same answer for a chord that does not open.** It
names which prefix resolved to which section and out of whose table — the
client's live bindings, or the shipped fallback — plus how full each layout is
and whether it came from the options page or the defaults. A tab command the
client has bound to a *modified* key gets no chord at all rather than a guessed
one, and that is the one silent case, so it is listed by name.

The list of bindable objects is read from **the client's own rules**, in the game
tab, and kept in storage for the options page (which has no game and therefore no
rules of its own). It is harvested once per client version; **play one match**
with the extension installed and the picker fills in. A match rather than an
open client: the client parses its rules during its own boot, long before the
main menu, but the harvest that reads them is fired at idle from a config push
that regularly arrives while the splash screen is still up — so match start is
the attempt that reliably lands, and the same holds for the colour table and the
object table. The names, costs and
pictures come off the same trip: the object table and the cameo sheet the replay
views already read, harvested from that client and never shipped in this repo.

## The net readout

**`7`** puts the numbers behind the client's own `Ctrl+R` panel on screen as
text: ping to the game server, how long your own orders take to come back,
frames per second, the lockstep's turn length, and every player's ping. It drags
anywhere and stays where you leave it, like the production panel.

| row | what it is |
|---|---|
| **ping** | one round trip to the game server, plus the client's own median over the match |
| **order** | the gap between an order of yours going out and coming back — the number that decides how a press feels |
| **frames** | frames a second, counted here rather than read off the client's widget |
| **turn** | the network turn the server has settled on for the whole lobby, against the game turn this match's speed asks for |
| **players** | each player's ping and connection, with the age of the reading |

Colours are the client's own bands, from `gui/component/PingIndicator`: green
under 100 ms, yellow under 250, red past it. A number this panel calls bad is
the same number the scoreboard draws a red bar for.

### It is not a copy of the client's panel — it reads the same sources

`GameScreen#initNetStats` builds a `PingMonitor` at match start **whatever the
FPS flag says**, and calls `monitor()`. The flag decides two other things:
whether a `NetStats` exists to paint the samples as stats.js graphs, and how
often a sample is taken — every second with the panel up, every ten seconds with
it down. So the values are there for the reading with the client's panel closed.

One hook is the whole capture, because the `PingMonitor` instance carries the
rest: `gameTurnMgr` is the match's `LockstepManager`, `gservCon` is the server
connection, and `avgPing` is the client's own `MedianPing` reservoir. The
extension hooks `PingMonitor#monitor` — an instance method, for the same reason
every other capture here does: a constructor cannot be patched through the
prototype.

**Ping and order latency are different numbers and the difference is the point.**
Ping is one IRC round trip to the server. Order latency is measured across the
lockstep — `onActionsSent` against `onActionsReceived` for the same network turn
— so it carries the turn scheduling as well as the wire, and it is the one that
matches what a press feels like. See
[The lag](#the-lag-and-why-a-press-does-not-wait-for-it) for what the extension
does about that latency rather than merely reporting it.

**The turn row is where someone else's connection shows up.** The server
stretches the network turn to the slowest client in the lobby; the game turn is
what this match's speed asks for. Equal is the healthy case. And when a turn is
stuck long enough, the client raises its own lag state (`onLagStateChange`) —
the panel says *waiting for the other clients* rather than leaving you to guess
at a frozen screen.

### What it puts on the wire, stated plainly

**One thing, and it is the client's own ping at the client's own faster rate.**
While the panel is open the extension calls `setPingInterval(1000)`, which is
exactly what the client does for itself when `Ctrl+R` is on; closing the panel
hands the rate back to ten seconds unless the client's own panel is up. The
call is made once a second rather than once on opening, because the client
resets that interval whenever its FPS panel is toggled — which would otherwise
leave this panel quietly showing a ten-second-old number as if it were current.

**Per-player ping is read passively and never asked for.** The `loadinfo`
answer carries every player's name, connection status, load percentage, ping and
lag allowance, and the client requests it once a second while the loading screen
is up and every ten seconds while its own in-game menu is open. The extension
subscribes to the answer and parses it with the client's own `LoadInfoParser`.
It does not send the request. That is why those rows carry an age: they are as
fresh as the last time *the client* asked, and they go stale on purpose rather
than being kept warm by traffic this extension invented.

Frames per second is the one number that is ours: `renderer.getStats()` exists
only while the client's panel is up, so the panel counts its own frames on the
same `requestAnimationFrame`. It stops counting in a hidden tab, which is
correct — a hidden tab is not rendering at all (`GameAnimationLoop` switches to
a one-second background tick), so a frame rate measured there would be a number
about nothing.

`__cdc.probe()` reports whether the hook took, so a dead hook is visible without
starting a match at all.

`node scripts/check-net.mjs` runs the whole panel without a browser or a match —
the section is sliced out of `companion.js` and driven against a stub client and
a stub DOM. It pins the bands against the client's own thresholds, the two ways
the order latency can lie (timing a turn that was never sent, and a map that
grows one entry per turn), the age label, which ping interval is asked for in
each of the three states, and that detaching a finished match releases all five
subscriptions.

## Player colours

**Options page → Settings → Player colours.** Off by default. Ticked, it
paints a match by **role** rather than by lobby slot: one colour for you, one for
your allies, and an **ordered list for opponents** — the first opponent takes the
first, the second takes the second. Any row left on *as picked* changes nothing,
so forcing one role and leaving the rest alone is a first-class answer.

The ordering is what makes this more than "every enemy is red": all-enemies-one-
colour merges two opponents into one side in 2v2 and free-for-all. A **blank row
holds its place** — leaving the first opponent as picked and setting the second
still paints the *second* opponent, rather than promoting everyone up by one, so
a row means the same opponent whatever the rows above it say.

Three surfaces follow the setting: the match itself, the roster on our
loading-screen panel and the `1` overlay, and the client's own loading-screen
rows. On the loading screen there are no players yet, only the lobby's slots, so
**allies there are the lobby's teams** rather than a live alliance — and if two
people picked the same country, "you" is ambiguous and that screen is left in the
client's colours rather than painted from a guess. The match itself has no such
doubt.

### The game repaints itself

The whole feature is one assignment: `player.color = rules.colors.get(name)`.
Every renderable the client builds re-reads its owner's colour on each update and
re-remaps its palette when it differs — the path that exists so a mind-controlled
tank turns Yuri's colour — so one write repaints that player's army, their radar
blips, their health bars and their control-group tags. **Nothing here draws
anything.**

It is applied from `Game#init`, which is the first moment every player's role
exists (the client forms the lobby's teams into alliances at the end of it) and
the last before anything has been drawn in the wrong colour. An alliance formed
or broken mid-match repaints too; the radar takes a tile's colour when the tile
is dirtied rather than every frame, so blips already on it keep the old colour
until each object next moves.

**A colour is only ever taken by name out of the client's own rules.** With
sprite batching on, a batched voxel builder resolves its palette by content hash
against a list precomputed from `rules.colors`, and throws *inside the render
loop* when the hash misses — so an invented red is a crash rather than a red.
That is why the options page offers a table harvested from the client — the same
trip that reads the build roster, and it fills in when you **play a match**, not
when you open the client — instead of colours of its own, and why a name
this client does not define is skipped with a line in the log rather than
guessed at. `node scripts/check-colours.mjs` asserts the section never
constructs a colour, along with the ordinals, the observer and empty-table
cases, and that the alliance watch is released with the match it belongs to.

**It is local render state and nothing else.** Colour is absent from
`Player#getHash()`, which is what the lockstep compares, and nothing sends it: no
desync, nothing on the wire, and no information a client did not already hold —
every client knows every alliance already, because the action that forms one
travels through the same lockstep everyone replays.

## Per-map guides

The extension's **options page** — click the extension's toolbar icon, or
`chrome://extensions` → Details → Extension options — is a row of tabs:

| tab | what it is |
|---|---|
| **Ladder 1x1** | the 1v1 ranked pool, and the guides of the maps it plays |
| **Ladder 2x2** | the same instrument pointed at the 2v2 pool, which is a different set of maps |
| **Stored maps** | everything this machine is holding, whatever ladder it belongs to — a ladder tab lists that pool's maps and nothing else |
| **Settings** | everything the extension has of its own — the hotkeys it takes, the keys that build, and everything it draws over the game |
| **Backup** | your bindings, plus the game's own hotkeys and options — which it keeps where you cannot copy them — into a single file |
| **Log** | what the extension did, kept in storage so it outlives the tab that did it |
| **Replays** | a ladder replay's build orders, read out of the file |

A ladder tab lists that ladder's maps, each with its own preview and a free-form
text box: write as much as you want for that map — paragraphs, a build order,
notes per start position. **Only that ladder's maps** — the pool sampled in the
tab above is what decides which cards appear, so a map the ladder does not play
has no card in either tab.

The guide takes **the hint slot itself**, in both places: on the loading screen
and in the in-game overlay it appears exactly where a hint would, replacing the
rotating ones for that map and scrolling if it is long. No second panel. An edit
reaches a running game immediately — no reload.

Maps with no guide of their own keep the rotating one-liners derived from the
map (start positions, size, theater) and the generic advice.

Maps are catalogued automatically the moment the client parses one, **keyed by
the map's file name** — a map file has no dependable name of its own, and two
maps can share a title. That name is not always a `.map`: the ladder plays YR
ports that keep the Yuri's Revenge extension (`4_tutankhamun_yrport.mpr`), so
`.mpr` and `.yrm` count as map files everywhere one is recognised. The thumbnail
stored for the list is downscaled, and the catalogue keeps the 120 most recently
seen maps.

### What a card knows about the map, without the engine

A card also carries **`objects`** — what the map holds, counted once and kept:
per sprite type (smudges, overlays, bridges, ore, terrain objects, buildings), a
tally by object name, and the structures grouped by kind with who owns each one
and how it got that way. A few kilobytes beside a thumbnail of a hundred.

It exists because the map file does not survive a render. A run fetches the
bytes through the client's own `MapFileLoader`, parses them into a `MapFile`,
draws it, and drops both — what is stored is pictures (`renders`, `full:<map>`),
and a picture is not an index. So "does this map have airports" was answerable
only by looking at a 3000px PNG — and on the options page, which has no client
at all, not in any form.

`__cdcHq.survey()` is the same walk as the render's with nothing drawn: **rules
only, no theater**, so it costs no download and answers for a map whose art this
client has never fetched. It travels with the *card* rather than with the
render, because a render is skipped when the stored one is current and the index
would then never be written for any map already rendered. `scripts/check-survey.mjs`
runs it over a hand-built pre-captured map with the client faked, because a
miscount here is not a wrong pixel the next render corrects — it is a wrong fact
that outlives the client that produced it.

Storing the map **file** instead was considered and dropped: it is hundreds of
kilobytes a map, and it would not remove the engine from the loop anyway, since
drawing needs the theater art and only the client can fetch that
(`theaterFor()` in `src/hq-preview.js`). The bytes say what is where; they do not
say what it looks like.

The **name** on a card comes from the client's own map list
(`MapManifest#getFullMapTitle`), not from the game options. In a match started
by anyone else — ranked play included — `mapTitle` in the options came off the
wire and turns out to carry the manifest's CSF *key*: `NOSTR:Emerald Lake`,
`NAME:WEEK6`, `DESC:MP01DU`. Cards written by an older build under such a name
are renamed in place the first time a game tab has both the catalogue and the
client's map list in front of it — once per tab, and only the ones that
disagree.

Mechanically this needs both worlds: `companion.js` runs in the page's MAIN
world and cannot see `chrome.storage`, so `bridge.js` runs in the isolated world
alongside it and the two talk over `window.postMessage`.

The preview auto-anchors to the radar — the in-game HUD is WebGL, so there is no
element to attach to, but the `Minimap` UiObject reports its position and fit
size in the same pixel space as this overlay. **Drag** the preview to move it,
drag its bottom-right corner to resize; the position is remembered per browser.
`__cdc.resetLayout()` puts it back on the radar.

**Every one of these keys is reassignable** under **Settings** in the
options page — click the key, press the combination. That matters because a
hotkey can be taken by three layers and only you can see all three: the game,
the browser, and Windows. An Alt+Shift binding was the first casualty —
**Alt+Shift is the Windows keyboard-layout switch**, so on a machine with two
layouts it never reaches the page at all. Nothing defaults to Alt+Shift now.
The one thing true of every key is a line of text above them;
what each key *does* is a **?** on its own row, and so is a binding the extension
can see a problem with — no modifier at all, so the game acts on the key too;
Alt+Shift, which may never arrive. The symbol turns amber when it has a warning.

For the game layer the check is live rather than assumed: the extension reads
the client's own `KeyBinds` table as it is built — defaults and your own
customised binds alike — and `__cdc.build()` reports whether a binding of yours
collides with a game command. The client does use Alt combinations (Alt+S
toggles shroud).

## Diagnosing it

`__cdc.probe()` in the game tab's console (page context) is the first thing to
run: it re-checks every assumption this extension makes about the client and
prints which ones still hold, as a table. `__cdc.build()` answers the same
question for a build hotkey — which binding a press resolves to, and whether the
client had a command on that key — and `__cdc.chords()` for a chord, including
which prefixes resolved and from whose table.

The first line of every diagnosis is the **version**: `__cdc.version` against
`manifest.json`. If they differ, the extension did not reload and nothing else
you see is current. `chrome://extensions` → the reload arrow on the card.

If the map preview is missing, the loading screen says so in the preview's own
slot instead of showing nothing.

### The log, which outlives the tab

A render run happens in a tab the extension opens and closes by itself, so the
run whose result you are questioning is exactly the run whose narration goes
with it. The **Log** tab on the options page is that narration kept in storage:
the last 400 lines, newest at the bottom, filterable, with *Problems only* for
the warnings and errors alone.

Two sources feed it. The game tab's own narration, and, from the half that owns
storage, **every write: attempted,
then stored or failed.** The attempt is logged before the write starts, which
is the whole point: a write that fails and a write that is never started look
identical afterwards, and one of those is what left a map with a render and no
card. `scripts/check-log.mjs` is the test of both rules, including that the log
is handed over *before* the run's tab is allowed to close.

The worker owns the key (`background.js`, `appendLog`), because three halves
write to it and a key with three independent read-modify-write cycles loses
entries.

### Reading it from a shell

```
node scripts/read-storage.mjs            # every key in the extension's storage
node scripts/read-storage.mjs log        # the log, one line per entry
node scripts/read-storage.mjs pools bulk # any key, as JSON
```

`chrome.storage.local` is a LevelDB in the browser profile, and that script
reads it **while the browser is running** — the tables in place, the
write-ahead log through a copy. It finds the profile itself by looking for an
unpacked extension loaded from this repo, so there is no id to keep up to date.

This is what makes the log worth having for someone who is not sitting at the
machine: a question about what the extension did is answered from a terminal,
with no browser, no devtools and nothing to copy out by hand. It has no
dependencies — snappy and the sstable format are implemented in the script,
because this repo has no `package.json` and neither is available to it.

## The render in the UI

The render is made **automatically, once per map**, right after a match finishes
loading — that is the first moment the theater art exists — and stored. Every
place that shows it reads from that store; none can produce one, so a map you
have never played has no render. *Render a map the first time it is played*,
under **Settings**, is what turns that off; a render is then only made
by *Render ticked* on a ladder tab or a card's own *Re-render*.

**Both preview slots show it** — the loading screen and the in-game overlay —
and fall back to the map's baked-in bitmap when there is none yet. The loading
screen takes the full-size render (it is half the screen) and the overlay the
400px thumbnail, which is a different picture rather than the same one smaller:
its marks are drawn for a box that size. A stored render is asked for the moment
the map is captured rather than after the theater art downloads, which is what
gets it onto the loading screen instead of just after it — a map rendered in
this tab still appears mid-loading only if it finishes in time.

In game:

| Key | What |
|---|---|
| **Alt+Enter** | the game's own fullscreen, moved off Alt+F (a setting) |
| **`5`** | the game's own menu, moved off Escape (a setting) — press it again, or Escape, to leave |
| **Esc** | closes the game's menu, or the full render; in a match with neither on screen, nothing |
| **`3`** | swap both previews between the client's and ours, and keep the answer |
| **`4`** | the whole render over the game, 90% of the viewport, translucent — click anywhere or press Esc to dismiss |
| **`2`** | the production panel — all six queues, the empty ones included |
| **qq · ww · ee · rr** | the sidebar tab as a grid of cameos under the cursor, each carrying its queue (see [Build chords](#build-chords)) — one press instead of two is a setting |
| **a slot key held down** (~0.5 s) | fills that queue — the tap has already ordered one, the hold adds the rest that fits |
| **Alt+slot key** | pause what that slot is building; again to cancel it. **Alt+Shift** cancels five, **Alt held down** cancels the lot |
| **right click on a tile** | pause what is building, or cancel one of what is queued — Shift cancels all of them |
| **Ctrl+q · w · e · r** | pause what that tab is building; again to cancel it. A finished building cancels at once |
| **Ctrl+Shift+q · w · e · r** | cancel five, pausing first if it was still running |
| **the key of a superweapon you own** | aims it — the client's targeting mode, so you still click the target |
| **wwt (America) · wwg** | the two paradrops, which have no building key of their own |

Which picture is shown is decided in three places, and they do not all mean the
same thing:

- **Use the map's own preview**, under **Settings** → *Overlay options*, is the answer for
  the two in-game slots — the loading-screen panel and the overlay. It is off, so
  in game the default is our render wherever there is one.
- **Show the map's own preview on cards**, in a ladder tab's list bar, is the
  answer for *this page* — the cards and the viewer a click opens. It used to be
  the same setting as the one above, which made a checkbox in a list of map
  guides silently change what the game drew.
- Each card has **Render · Original · Default** under its picture, and that beats
  both for that one map, on the page and in game alike. Our render is worth more
  on most maps and less on a few — a map whose own preview marks something the
  render does not — which is the whole reason a per-map answer exists. *Render*
  is dead on a map that has none; the button under the guide makes one.

Changes reach a running game immediately. **`3` writes the in-game setting**
rather than flipping it for the session: the choice survives a reload, and the
checkbox moves with it. If the map in play had a card setting of its own, the
swap clears it — that setting outranks the default, so leaving it would mean the
key wrote something nothing on screen obeyed.

Clicking a picture opens the full-size render — scroll to zoom in on the point
under the cursor, drag to move, double-click to fit again. Both hotkeys are
rebindable next to the others.

### Original means the map's own picture

Nothing of ours is drawn on it. It used to carry the client's numbered start
locations, put there by this extension on purpose (`MapPreviewRenderer#drawStartLocations`,
which is what the lobby uses) — but those are the lobby's furniture rather than
part of the map, and with them baked in there was no way to see the picture
underneath.

They were doing one job worth keeping. Many maps mark their own start positions
in the preview — a red dot, drawn by whoever made the map — and many do not, and
the numbers covered for both. So the preview is checked for a marker of its own,
and **one found anywhere settles it for the whole map**: a map that marks its
spawns is shown exactly as it is, and only a map that marks none gets dots of
ours, in the same red, at every start position. Per-position was the first rule
and it was worse — the marker a map draws and the start cell the client computes
only roughly agree, so a marked map would come back with a second dot beside one
of its own.

Where dots were added the card carries **Show missed spawn points**, on by
default, per map: off shows the map's picture untouched.

What counts as a marker is **the same vivid colour near more than one start
position** — half of them, minimum two. Not "is there something red near this
spawn": that finds red-brown rock on every desert map, and *Arabian Oasis (YR
Port)*, which marks nothing at all, was read as marking everything and got no
dots. A map that marks its spawns draws the same marker at each one, and terrain
does not do that. Vivid means bright with a wide gap between its strongest and
weakest channel, so sand — bright, barely saturated — is not it.

`scripts/check-spawn-marks.mjs` runs the detector against bitmaps built for the
purpose: bare terrain, desert, a patch of rock beside one spawn, matching
markers, mismatched ones, a marker at one spawn only, and single stray pixels.
It also drives the whole preview path, to check that a map which marks its
spawns comes back with no dots and no toggle.

**Cards already in the catalogue keep the picture they were stored with.** The
preview is drawn in the game tab and stored whole, so nothing here can redraw
one — pressing **Render** on a card, or *Render ticked* over the ladder pool,
is what replaces it.

**Re-render**, on a card, draws that one map again and replaces its stored
render (it says **Render** on a map that has none). It is the same machinery as
the bulk run below — a game tab does the work, opened for it if none is running,
and the card says what happened — with one difference: it redoes a render the
current renderer already made, which nothing else will. That is what to press
when a render came out against theater art that had not finished loading.

Renders are megabytes, so the extension asks for `unlimitedStorage`, keeps the
last 60 (`MAX_RENDERS` in `src/bridge.js`), and the options page has **Clear
renders** (guides and the map list stay). Auto-rendering costs a second or two
of idle work per new map; nothing happens at all for a map already stored.

## Full map render

The fallback preview is the bitmap baked into the map file — a couple of pixels
per cell, so upscaling it only enlarges the blur. `src/hq-preview.js` renders the
map from its own cell data and the client's own art instead: terrain tiles, ore
and gems, walls, bridges, trees, smudges and structures, each drawn from the
SHP the game itself would draw.

Load any map, then in the console (page context):

```js
await __cdcHq.render()                     // full resolution, opens the PNG in a new tab
await __cdcHq.render({ maxWidth: 2000 })   // downscaled
await __cdcHq.render({ crop: false })      // include the border area outside LocalSize
await __cdcHq.render({ objects: false })   // terrain only
await __cdcHq.render({ annotate: false })  // no ore borders, no ownership outlines
await __cdcHq.render({ outlines: false })  // keep the ore borders, drop the building rings
await __cdcHq.render({ grid: true })       // overlay the cell grid
__cdcHq.list()                             // the map's structures: names, owners, colours, icons
await __cdcHq.survey()                     // the same walk as a stored object, no art needed
await __cdcHq.render({ tune: { x: 0, y: -15 } })     // nudge every sprite pass
await __cdcHq.render({ fix: { terrain: { y: 15 } } })       // nudge one sprite type
await __cdcHq.render({ fixByName: { CAAIRP: { x: 7 } } })   // nudge one object
await __cdcHq.sample()                     // capture this map split into per-type layers
__cdcHq.save("bay-of-pigs")                // download the last render
```

On top of the art it draws what a player actually reads a map for:

| Mark | Means |
|---|---|
| yellow tint and border | an ore patch |
| violet tint and border | gems |
| solid block of cells | a start position, sized to the Construction Yard that will stand there, numbered |
| green outline | a capturable building standing unowned |
| player-coloured outline, and the building painted that colour | a building the map hands to a player at match start |
| a pictogram floating above it | what taking it gets you — the same glyphs the thumbnail uses, riding above the footprint rather than on it, so the outline still says which ground it stands on and the art stays visible. **Drawn over the picture, not into it**, so *Mark tech buildings on the full render* (in game, under **Settings**) and *Mark tech buildings in the viewer* (this page, in a ladder tab's list bar) turn them off on renders you already have, with nothing to re-render |

Outlined: **buildings you can take, and buildings a trigger hands to a player
before the match starts** — ordinary civilian scenery is left alone. Ownership
alone does not earn a mark: a map can give a street lamp to a house that happens
to be a country (Country Swing does, on all four of its near-base ore drills),
and marking that buries the drill under a pictogram. An owned building is still
remapped to its player's colour, the way the game colours it. Player colours run
blue, red, orange, pink, cyan, white, brown, grey — chosen so they never collide
with the green of an unowned building or the yellow/violet of ore. Which player
owns what is attributed to the nearest start position, since the map file names
an owning country rather than a slot.

The outline goes on **before** the building, not after. It is a statement about
the ground the building stands on, so the building — and any tree in front of it
— hides it exactly the way it hides the ground: the two near edges of the
footprint stay, and how much of the two far edges survives is how much relief
the building has.

### The two sizes are two pictures

`thumb` (400px) and `full` (3000px) are not one render at two scales. At 400px a
cell is under three pixels, where a 35% tint reads as a smudge, a 3px border as
nothing and a building as four grey pixels — so the thumbnail gets its own
vocabulary, drawn *after* the downscale so it is sized in the pixels it has:

| Mark | Thumbnail |
|---|---|
| ore / gems | solid saturated yellow / violet, not a tint — at this size the question is only how much of the map is worth harvesting |
| an ore drill | a black dot: the drill is why a patch refills, and black is the one ink a yellow field cannot swallow |
| a marked building | a pictogram of what it is *for*, drawn **instead of** the building rather than above it: droplet = oil derrick, cross = hospital, parachute = airport, wrench = repair (machine shop or outpost), flask = secret lab, diamond = something else worth taking |
| a pictogram's colour | white while unowned, the player's colour where the map hands the building over |
| a start position | a numbered square in the player's colour — the Construction Yard footprint is eleven pixels by five here, which holds no number |

So the glyphs are the one vocabulary the two sizes share; where they sit is what
differs, and it follows from whether the building under them is legible.

The pictograms carry a dark halo rather than a backing disc, so the glyph gets
the whole mark instead of the inside of a circle. They are not all drawn at the
style's box: `ICON_SCALE` (in `src/glyphs.js`) gives the parachute and the wrench half again as much,
because a canopy with air under it and a thin tool on a diagonal leave most of a
24×24 box empty and read as smaller marks beside a cross. The correction is
optical, judged on the glyph sheet, not measured off the paths. The start
square's number is black or white by the player colour's luma — a fixed ink
disappears on player 6 (white) at one end or player 1 (blue) at the other.

The glyphs themselves are `src/glyphs.js`, not the renderer: three places draw
them and only one can load the renderer — the render in the game tab, the
options page compositing badges over a full render that has none baked in, and
`scripts/glyph-sheet.mjs`. The full render stores *where* its badges go, as
fractions of the picture, and whoever shows it paints them.

`__cdcHq.list()` prints the glyph each structure gets, so a tech building this
build has no icon for shows up as `marker` rather than disappearing into the
map; add it to `BUILDING_ICONS` in `src/glyphs.js`. Both styles are
`MARK_STYLES` in the same file, and `render({ sizes: { x: { width: 600, marks:
"compact" } } })` renders any width in either.

`node scripts/glyph-sheet.mjs` writes `scripts/glyph-sheet.html`: every
pictogram drawn by the shipped code, big enough to judge and again at the real
18px in white and every player colour. `?only=<glyph>` blows one up to 340px,
where a corner or a tangent that 96px hides is visible. Regenerate after
touching `ICON_GLYPHS` — a glyph is a shape, and a shape is looked at, not
reasoned about.

`grid: true` draws the cell grid over the render — the measuring stick when
something looks misplaced.

It needs the theater art, which the client downloads while a map loads — so a
render only happens once a game has started. Any later map works too, whatever
its theater: a missing one is fetched through the client's own loader (see the
bulk section below). Each map is rendered and stored once as it loads, and the console
calls above are for looking at one by hand.

### Ladder maps, rendered in bulk

A render used to exist only for a map you had **played** since the feature
landed, and only ever at the renderer of the day. Neither is true any more.

Every stored render carries the version of the renderer that made it
(`RENDERER_VERSION` in `src/hq-preview.js`). Playing a map whose render is
behind renders it again instead of skipping it — and the options page can redo a
whole set without playing anything.

There are **two ranked ladders**, and they are two different pools rather than
one: the 1v1 ladder plays 2-player maps and the 2v2 ladder mostly 4-player ones,
with only a handful in common. Each has its own tab, its own sample, its own
ticks and its own list of cards; nothing measured in one is evidence about the
other. (The API keys the team ladder `2v2-random`, not `2v2` — the client keeps
the queue name and the ladder name in separate enums, and it is the ladder name
that goes in the URL. See `LADDERS` in `src/ladder.js`.)

In each ladder tab, under a foldable **Ladder maps** block — set the pool up
once, then fold it away and leave the guides below it on screen. Its summary
carries what the sample is a claim about — who was read, over which period, and
when — so a folded block still states its own provenance. Counts are not in it:
each one lives where it is acted on, on the button or beside it. A ladder with
no sample yet opens unfolded, because the button that fixes that is inside it:

- **Find ladder maps** measures the ranked pool. Nothing publishes it — it is
  decided server-side — but every ranked match names its map, so a slice of the
  ladder plus each player's recent matches gives the pool that is actually in
  play, with the match counts and last-played dates it was derived from. The
  readout names the period the matches were played over as well as the day the
  sample was taken: a pool is a claim about a stretch of time, and the two dates
  are not the same fact. A row states its last-played date **only when that is
  not the day the ladder was read**, in a colour of its own — nearly every row
  of a live pool was played that day, and the date repeated down the whole list
  buried the rows where it is not, which are the maps on their way out. Untick
  anything you do not want; **Select all** and **Clear selection** move every
  tick at once.
- **Each row ends on two verdicts** — which file the ladder plays, and what this
  machine holds of it — because "18 maps on the ladder, 16 cards below" is
  otherwise a discrepancy you have to find by reading both lists side by side.
  A resolved file name reads in the same ink as the title — it is a name, not a
  verdict, and the row's colour belongs to the mark at the end of it. **Red**
  *file unresolved* when no replay would name it, which leaves the map matched
  by its title, and a title can name two maps. The mark after it says what is
  held: green *rendered*, amber *no render* for a map with a card but only its
  own low-resolution preview, amber *rendered by title* for one drawn on a title
  match rather than a file match, amber *rendered, no card* for a render in
  storage that the catalogue has no entry for, red *not rendered* when nothing
  here answers to it at all. How many of them are drawn is stated beside the
  buttons — *Rendered 18 of 21 maps* — which is that slot's resting state: a
  message takes it while it has something to say and gives it back afterwards.
- **A pool remembers which resolver read it.** A stored sample outlives the code
  that made it: when the resolver learned to read `.mpr` names, the two YR ports
  in the 2v2 pool went on saying *file unresolved*, correctly — that is what the
  sample said, taken before the fix — and nothing on screen could tell that from
  a map the ladder genuinely never names. The summary now ends on *resolved by
  an older build* when it does — with the *re-sample to fix the files* half
  behind the `?` beside it — and the tooltip on such a row says the same. `RESOLVER_VERSION` in `src/ladder.js` is the stamp,
  raised whenever a change there would answer differently for the same ladder.
- **Render ticked** renders them. The options page cannot do this itself — it has
  no game client and therefore no theater art — so a game tab does the work and
  reports progress back. **It no longer has to be one you opened**: if nothing
  answers within a second and a half, the extension opens one in the background,
  the run happens there, and the tab closes itself when it ends. A map already
  rendered by the current renderer is skipped — a card's own **Re-render** is
  what redoes one of those. **One run at a time across both tabs** — there is one
  game tab doing the work, so a run started in either makes *Render ticked* busy
  in both, and the progress is reported in the tab that asked for it. **What it
  did, not how much work it was**: skips are counted apart from renders, so the
  second run over a pool ends on *nothing to redo — all 21 already current*
  rather than *rendered 0 of 21* beside a summary saying *21/21 rendered*.
- **Clear sampled pool** deletes the sample and its ticks. Renders, guides and
  the map list are untouched.

Nothing is hoarded during a match to make this work. The client already knows
every map (`Engine.getMapList()`) and already knows how to fetch one
(`MapFileLoader#load` — the game's own archives first, the maps CDN second), so
the run asks it, the same way the game does.

**How a run gets a client.** The request is a storage write; a game tab that is
already open picks it up in milliseconds. If none has after 1.5 s the options
page asks the service worker — the only half of the extension that can open a
tab — for one, inactive so it never takes the screen and muted so the client's
menu music does not take the room either. The bridge in that tab
finds the request in storage as it loads, the run waits for the client to finish
booting (up to three minutes: a cold client downloads its base data first), and
when the run ends the tab asks the worker to close it again.

A hidden tab is not a free one, though: Chrome clamps its timers and gives it no
animation frames at all, and the client's own start-up uses both. So a tab that
shows no sign of a client after 25 s is **brought to the front by the extension**
and says so, rather than sitting there looking like a slow one. Nothing here is
ever something to do by hand — if a run needs a client, it gets one. (A replay
re-run no longer waits for that: it holds the frame pump below for the client's
boot, and boots where it stands. A render run still nudges.) **Only a tab the
worker opened is ever closed** — the ids live in `chrome.storage.session`,
because an MV3 worker is torn down while idle and a run takes minutes, and
`scripts/check-background.mjs` is a test of that one rule. A run in a tab you
opened yourself leaves it exactly where it was.

The limits are worth knowing:

- **Theater art comes from the client, and a match is no longer the price of
  it.** With locally imported game files any theater loads cold. In CDN resource
  mode `Engine.loadTheater` does not fetch — it builds a theater out of the VFS
  — so only theaters played this session used to work, and a run started after a
  temperate game rendered the temperate maps and failed every snow one. The
  fetching half is `GameLoader#loadTheater`, and the extension used to reach it
  by holding the `GameLoader` the client built when a match started: *one match,
  any theater, unlocked the whole pool*, and a tab that had played nothing could
  do nothing.

  That requirement is gone. `GameLoader#loadTheater` reads exactly two fields of
  its own object — `gameResConfig.isCdn()` and `cdnResourceLoader` — and both
  can be built from parts the client already has up on its main menu: the CDN
  base out of `ImageContext.cdnBaseUrl`, the checksums out of `manifest.json` at
  that base, and `Engine.getCacheDir()` for the cache. So the extension calls
  the client's own `loadTheater` with a stand-in of two fields, and a tab that
  has only reached the main menu renders anything. The cache is the client's own,
  which means a mix it has already downloaded is read from disk — and the main
  menu prefetches every theater into it a few seconds after it appears.
  `__cdc.probe()` still reports `gameLoaderHeld`; it now says which of the two
  routes a run will take, not whether it can run at all.
- **A run reports what was stored, not just what was rendered.** `render()`
  resolving means the picture exists in the tab; it still has to cross into the
  other world and be written, and a write can fail there. A failed write now
  lands in the run's failure list even when the acknowledgement arrives after the
  run has finished. A map whose file carries no `[PreviewPack]` is listed too:
  it renders fine and gets no card, which makes it invisible in the catalogue.
  The map list header shows how many renders are stored and how many megabytes
  they take, which is what separates "storage is full" from "that map is broken"
  — as **`N of NN renders stored · M MB of MM MB in storage`**, the tab's own
  share against the extension's whole, because a page split by ladder invites
  the question of which ladder is costing the space. The megabytes counted for a
  tab are its full-size renders; thumbnails share one storage item and cannot be
  weighed per map, so the two figures are not meant to add up to each other
  (hover the readout — it says so).
- **Storage.** Sixty renders at up to ~24 MB each is the ceiling
  (`MAX_RENDERS` in `src/bridge.js`), which is what the extension asks for
  `unlimitedStorage` for. *Clear renders* empties it; the **Stored maps** tab
  below empties it a map at a time.

### Stored maps

A ladder tab lists that pool's maps and nothing else, so a map rendered from a
match on anything the ladder does not play — a third of a real store — had no
card anywhere, and the only way to delete one was *Clear renders*, which deletes
all of them.

The **Stored maps** tab is the store's own view. Every map that has a card or a
render, **heaviest first**, because the reason to open it is usually that storage
is filling up; each row says what its render costs, when it was made, which
renderer made it, whether it has a guide, and which sampled pool it is in. Tick
rows — or *Select all*, which takes whatever the filter left — and then either

- **Delete renders**, which takes the picture and its index entry together and
  keeps the card and the guide, so the map can be drawn again, or
- **Forget maps**, which takes the card as well.

The guide survives both. It is the one thing here a human wrote, and everything
else regenerates.

**The cap no longer eats guides.** Past `MAX_RENDERS` the store used to evict the
oldest render whatever it was, silently — which broke the one promise it makes,
that a map rendered once stays rendered. It now walks past any map with a guide
and past the map just rendered; if every candidate is spoken for, the store goes
over the cap rather than throwing notes away. What it does take is recorded, and
this tab says so until it is dismissed.

### Replays

**A ladder replay states its own build order, and reading it needs neither the
game nor a match.** A `.rpl` is a text file whose lines are the action frames the
client sent each network turn — so what every player queued, placed, sold and
cancelled is in there, timestamped to the tick. The **Replays** tab decodes one
and lays both build orders against **one clock down the middle**.

**Who won is beside the name**, as a `WON`/`LOST` badge, and the losing one
carries why and when in its parentheses — `LOST (RESIGNED 5:12)`. It comes out of
the file, not out of the ladder and not out of a re-run: the losing side is the
one that resigns or is dropped, and `DropPlayer` is what the client writes when a
base dies. It is said only when exactly one side is out — both or neither is a
match that ended some other way, and a guess there would be worse than silence.
A player who resigned and was then dropped is read by the **resignation**: the
drop that follows is the client noticing the consequence, not a second defeat.

**The header is a row per kind of line**, not a column per side — names opposite
names, statistics opposite statistics, losses opposite losses, all on the same
three-column grid the axis below uses. Two stacked columns bottom-aligned against
each other put a blank line above the shorter side and the same kind of fact at
two different heights. The faction sits on the nickname's line for the same
reason: a whole row of the header was being spent on one word.

**A header block is as wide as the panel, not as wide as the build order under
it.** The five columns of the grid are a picture gutter, a side's lines, the
clock, the other side's lines, a picture gutter — and the two gutters are what
absorb whatever the panel has left over, rather than the grid being centred with
the remainder down its two edges where nothing can be put. The header's blocks
span their gutter as well as their own column, so a side's losses read as chips
across the width instead of a stack one chip wide beside two strips of empty
panel. The clock column between them is untouched by the spans, which is what
keeps it over the axis's own.

The centre axis is the whole point of the layout. Two build orders in two
columns can only be compared by reading a time off one and hunting for it in the
other; with a shared axis the eye does it — who reached a refinery first is a
glance at which side of the same row is filled, and a run of rows filled on one
side only is a lead, visible without reading a word. Things done in the same
second share one clock reading rather than becoming two rows that look
sequential. A team game splits by team; a match that has no two sides (three
free-for-all players, or slots with no team id) falls back to a column per
player rather than inventing a pairing.

Two ways in, because a replay arrives under two different names:

- **paste** the leaderboard's game page (`ladder.chronodivide.com/…/game/<id>`),
  the client's own `#/replay/<url>` route, the `.rpl` link itself, or a bare game
  id;
- **list a player's recent ranked matches** off the ladder and click one — the
  same match-history call the pool sampler uses (`src/ladder.js`).

**Both ways in are remembered**, so the second time is a click: two panes sit
under the boxes, side by side and each under the box it fills — the replays that
have been opened on the left, and on the right the names the ladder has been
asked about over the list that answering one draws. A listed match is four short
columns, so stacked full width the pair was mostly air, and every line they took
was a line the report started lower by. A player entry carries the realm and
ladder it was last asked with, since the same name has a different history on
each, but it is **kept under the name alone**: asking 1v1 and then 2v2 about one
player used to write two chips reading the same word. It is written only when the
ladder answers with matches, so a typo never joins the list. A replay entry is
written after a successful read and holds everything its row needs — map, both
names, duration, when it was played — so the list draws with no request made.
Each entry has a `×` that removes that one.

They live in `localStorage`, beside the losses preference, rather than in
`chrome.storage.local` — that is the extension's measured half, and twelve short
strings have no business in that accounting. **Forgetting a replay costs the
shortcut and nothing else:** what re-running the match produced stays keyed by
game id in `chrome.storage.local.sims`, and opening the same replay again finds
it. Twelve of each are kept.

What a row means is the distinction the tab is built around:

**Every row leads with a mark, and there are two kinds of mark.** Which kind it
is, is said by the space.

- **A sign sits against the name, like arithmetic.** `+` got it, `−` lost it. A
  placement, a delivery and the taking half of a capture are all `+`: a building
  standing on the map, a tank driving out of a war factory and a refinery walking
  over to your side are the same claim about how the world changed.
- **A glyph a space away from the name is an action or a state, not a quantity.**
  `$` ordered, `✓` finished and waiting, `<>` deployed, `⇄` changed hands, `⚑`
  left the match. It never says whether anything was gained, which is why it can
  sit beside a sign and add to it rather than compete with it — `✓ +War Factory`
  is *finished, and standing*, two facts about one row.

The two were one list until 0.46.2, and the space was whatever each glyph
happened to carry: `+Rhino` and `✓ War Factory` looked like the same kind of
statement while `⇄` sat at the far end of its row saying a third thing in a
fourth position. One rule for where a mark goes is worth more than any of the
placements it overrides.

| row | what it is |
|---|---|
| `$ `, with a `×n` | **ordered** — what the game took into a queue at that second. Buildings get one too: deciding to build a war factory is an event, and it is on the timeline where it happened rather than in a tooltip |
| `$ `, dim, with a dashed rule | ordered and never placed — cancelled, or flushed when its factory died |
| `$ `, struck through | cancelled out of the queue. Its `×n` is what the player asked to take out — the model cannot say how much of a cancel the engine found, and the ask is the one number a cancel certainly has |
| `✓ `, dim accent, after a re-run | the building **finished** and stood waiting to be placed |
| `+`, in the page's accent | **placed** — the building exists at that second, and how far it sits from the `✓` above it is how long the player sat on it. A building placed the second it finished carries `✓ +`: both are true of the one row, and the `✓` is drawn at the readiness row's own dimness, because the bright claim here is that the building exists |
| `+n`, after a re-run | a unit **came out** of a queue. Buildings are not on this track: a building appears by being placed, and `tryPlaceBuilding` refuses unless the queue is already `Ready`, so the placement row is its delivery |
| `<> `, in violet, after a re-run | a base **stood up** — an MCV deploying. The one row that carries no sign: nothing was gained, a vehicle became a building; see below |
| `−n`, after a re-run | lost |
| `⇄ `, before the sign | the building **changed hands** — the `+` or `−` after it says which way. Two rows at one second, one on each side of the clock; see below |
| `⚑ `, in small caps | the side **left the match** — `resigned` where it was a decision, the quieter `dropped out` where the client recorded a dead base. It comes out of the file, so it is there with no re-run, and it is drawn above the losses of its own second: everything a resigning player owns dies in that instant, and the wall of `−` under the flag reads as its consequence |

Repeated orders of the same thing inside ten seconds fold into one row: eight
conscripts queued in two seconds is one decision, not eight.

**The pictures are the unit's own sidebar cameos**, in a gutter outside each
side's words — the icon the player clicked to order the thing, from the game's
own art, so the words keep touching the clock and the pictures stack into a strip
down each edge. The *icons* checkbox takes them away for a reading that wants the
words alone.

**A picture is per run, not per row, and its size says how long the run is.**
Where a stretch of one side's rows is about one thing — `Power Plant` ordered,
finished, placed, or four Rhinos coming out one after another — those rows get
**one** picture, drawn bigger, with a bracket down the gutter linking them to it.
Every picture, run or not, draws a leader from itself to the words, so a lone row
is as easy to associate as a braced one:

```
        ┌─ 0:04  $ Power Plant
 ▣▣▣    │  0:12  ✓ Power Plant
        └─ 0:14  +Power Plant

 ▪▪     ── 0:21  $ Conscript ×8
```

**A leader is one element, drawn by the row.** It reaches out of its own cell by
a negative margin into the gutter beside the picture, and the bracket's upright
stands at the far end of that reach and carries no horizontal of its own. Drawn
in two halves — an arm in the gutter meeting the row's rule at the column edge —
they were placed by two different rules and landed half a pixel apart, so one
rule rounded onto the same device row at some zooms and onto neighbouring ones at
others and stepped up or down halfway along.

**A run is one object's chain, not its name repeated.** Naming the same thing
twice running is necessary and not enough: the rows have to be one passage from
intent to existence — ordered, then finished, then standing. A **new order after
a placement starts a new section**, because that is a second building rather than
more news about the first; a **placement and a death** of one thing are two
pictures, because they are two events; and two rows that are neither stage of
anything join only when they are the same claim — two deaths are one loss, two
deliveries are one batch.

A line where only the *other* side acted does not break a run: the two columns
share one clock, so the opponent pushes this side's rows apart on the page
without putting anything between them, and an order and its placement are
seconds apart. What breaks a run is this side naming something else — and then
each row keeps its own small icon, at a size that leaves the row height exactly
where it was.

The sizes are only halves and doubles of the source's own 60×36, so the pixel art
is never resampled: **30×18** for a single line, **60×36** for a run spanning two
or three, **120×72** for four or more. That ladder is also what fits — at
12px/1.7 a line is 20.4px, so 36px needs two lines and 72px needs four. The
gutter is as wide as the largest picture the report actually uses, and collapses
to nothing when the icons are off.

**Each side's column is the longest line *that side* holds and no wider**, so the
picture beside it sits as close to the clock as the text ever gets. Two numbers,
not one: shared, the quieter column was padded out to the busier one's longest
line and its pictures stood a centimetre off its own text. The widths are counted
in characters rather than measured — the axis is monospace, so the longest line
*is* the widest one — which is also what lets the header and the axis, two grids,
agree about where the clock column is without either of them being laid out
first. There is no spare character in them: the few marks a row carries come from
a fallback face and may overhang a fraction into the gutter's padding, which a
line never wraps to accommodate.

**The clock column is counted too**, from the widest reading it actually prints
— which is `time`, the caption over it, on a report whose times are all shorter.
A fixed 56px was two guesses in one: too wide for `12:34`, which left a strip of
nothing down the middle twice over, since each side already keeps its own ten
pixels off the rules; and too narrow for `8:55 (35:42)`, which is what the `both`
clock prints, so every row of that report wrapped onto two lines and the axis came
out twice as tall.

They come from one sheet, and it is not in this repo: it is harvested from the
player's own running client and kept in storage, which is what every surface
that draws a cameo reads. Harvesting needs a game tab but no match, no lobby and
no login — the art is in the client's VFS from the moment the engine boots — and
takes about a tenth of a second.

The game's 60×48 cameo is cropped to its top 36 rows, which drops the unit's
name — painted into the artwork — and leaves the picture. An object the game
gives no cameo shows none rather than a stand-in; the two a build order needs and
the game does not have (both Construction Yards) borrow the icon of the thing
that becomes them.

**It happens on the way into the game** (0.75.0), without being asked and
without anything to ask about: nothing is downloaded, because the art is already
in the game files the client loaded. Every load compares two stamps — the
client's version and the harvester's own — and a client that has not changed
costs nothing at all. One that has, whether new art or a change to how the
harvest works, is picked up without anyone having to notice there was something
to pick up. **Never during a match**: a settings change pushes config to the game
tab too, so this can be reached mid-match, and a tenth of a second of the main
thread is invisible on a menu and about six dropped frames in a game. A cold
browser is retried for five minutes and otherwise left to the next visit —
measured rather than guessed: a fresh profile took just over two minutes to have
rules, which an earlier two-minute budget missed by seconds.

**It brings back more than the committed sheet ever had.** Measured against a
live client on 2026-08-20: **405 ids as 99 pictures**, six of them named by the
art and absent from the archives, against the 101 ids and 88 pictures the
offline generator produced. That route read `Cameo=` out of the art text by hand
and had to follow the `Image=` indirection itself; the client has already done
that for every object it knows.

**Harvest cameos** (0.74.0), on the Replays tab, is the same run asked for by
hand — it opens a game tab itself if none is listening, the way the replay
controls do. It is there to force a rebuild and to recover when the automatic
one has not happened; a pool render run harvests too, rather than asking twice.

Two reasons it exists, and the first is the one that matters. **The sheet this
repo used to commit was artwork from a retail Red Alert 2 install, and no licence
this repo can adopt covers it** — EA has never released RA2's assets, so shipping
those pixels asserted a right the author does not hold. Harvested at runtime they
never enter the repo. The second is that a harvest follows the client: it picks
up art changes without a regenerated commit, and it is the player's own
localisation rather than the Russian one baked into the install the committed
sheet came out of. It also carries seven superweapon icons where the generator
could reach only two, a superweapon having no `Image=` chain for the offline
route to walk.

**The committed sheet is now deleted**, along with the object table beside it and
the generators that built both. There is no fallback left, and that is deliberate
rather than an oversight: until a profile has harvested once, a build order draws
in words and names objects by their ids. Opening the game once with the extension
installed is the whole of the fix, and it happens without being asked.

**An order's count is what the game accepted, not how many times the mouse went
down.** The engine takes `min(asked, queue room, per-type room, build limit)` and
drops the rest, and the queues are small — 30 of a type in a unit tab, **one** building
at a time, and an aircraft queue no bigger than the free helipad docks. Since the
sidebar clamps a click against the player's *local* model, which lockstep only
advances when the action executes, a burst of clicks all see the same stale free
space and all get sent; the surplus is dropped on arrival. Those are
**overclicks**, counted apart and shown only when the checkbox above the timeline
asks for them — a row of 45 IFVs inside ten seconds is a description of a mouse,
not of a match. **A cancel is not one of them**: cancelling more than a queue
holds empties it in one gesture, and the shortfall is the model's, not the
player's (see the floor below).

Under the timeline are two charts, one line per side, with a crosshair that
names both numbers at whatever second you hover:

- **Ordered value** — credits committed, units as the queue took them and
  buildings as they were placed. It is *not* income and not a bank balance: a
  replay holds no credits at all. It reads as an economy curve only in the sense
  that a player who cannot pay stops ordering.
- **Actions per minute** over a rolling 60-second window — where each side was
  pushing, not how well. The divisor stops shrinking at 15 seconds, or the first
  action of a match draws a spike taller than anything that follows it.

Both series are drawn in the data-viz reference palette's first two dark steps
(`#3987e5`, `#d95926`), validated as a pair against this page's own panel colour:
worst CVD ΔE 26.8, normal-vision ΔE 31.8, both over 3:1 contrast. The same two
colours mark each side's name above the timeline, so the panels agree on who is
who.

**What a replay file cannot tell you**, and no amount of parsing will: credits,
kills, **losses**, or what a production queue actually finished. A replay records
what each player *did*; those are what *happened to them*, and only the
simulation knows. Buildings are the exception, which is why structures are the
spine of the report.

The queue model narrows the gap from one side and cannot close it. It is
deliberately the *fastest possible* queue — production that never runs out of
credits, never loses power, never loses a factory — so its occupancy is a floor
under the real one: every overclick it reports is certain, every accepted order
is an upper bound. **That floor is evidence in one direction only.** A queue
already full in the fastest possible model is certainly full in the real one,
which is what makes a refused order a fact; a *cancel* it cannot cover states
nothing at all, since the real queue held at least as much and may have absorbed
the whole thing. Reading the floor backwards is what once put 79 phantom
overclicks on a four-minute match that contains one. What it cannot see at all is the engine emptying a queue when
its factory dies, so beyond half a second since a queue was last touched it
resyncs rather than reject: the client would not have sent the order had its own
model shown the queue full. That window is measured — thirteen re-orders of a
building still in a queue that holds one, every one inside 0.27 s, and the next
observation 128 s away.

#### Run the match

So the tab has a second half. **Run the match** plays the replay through in a
game tab and reads the counters straight off the running match — measured on the
fixture game: **4:03 of play re-run in 5.7 seconds, 2543 game ticks a second, 42×
the speed it was played**. The tab is opened for it and closed afterwards, and
the harvest is stored per match, so it is a one-off cost per replay.

**The first seconds are not watched.** `play()` waits for the match to start by
polling `game.status` on a 250 ms sleep, and only then imports `EventType` and
subscribes to the spawns, deaths and captures — so at the ~1000 game-ticks a
second a harvest runs at, one poll interval is **hundreds of ticks, several game
seconds**, and everything inside it is gone rather than late. It shows in the
data: no harvest on disk holds a single tick-0 starting unit, and a fast opening
deploy can fall inside the window while the opponent's slower one survives. That
is why the base's arrival is read out of the **file** wherever the file can prove
it (below), and why a fix here means re-running every stored match.

What that adds to the report:

- **Losses on the timeline itself**, on the same clock as the build order and
  marked with a minus: `−War Miner ×4` at 2:09, then `−Sentry Gun` twice, then
  the base — `−Tesla Reactor`, `−Conscript ×20`, `−Soviet Barracks`, `−Soviet
  Construction Yard` — between 3:35 and 4:02. **Buildings are set in bold**,
  because a base coming apart is what the eye is scanning for and it should not
  read like infantry trickling away. They group the way orders do (44 deaths
  become 16 rows, or the build order drowns in its own casualties), and the
  *losses* switch above the timeline turns them off — beside *overclicks* and
  *icons*, which are the other two things that decide what these rows say. It
  only appears on a report that has been re-run, because only a harvest holds a
  loss to draw.
- **Losses by type and by side** in the header, **split at the moment the side
  left** — `13 LOST IN PLAY` over `27 LOST AT DEFEAT`, every type its own chip.
  Everything a resigning player owns is destroyed in the same instant, so one
  list misreads the whole match: `74 lost` is a base evaporating at 5:12 with a
  dozen fighting losses buried in it. A dropped side's at-defeat block is
  normally empty, and that is the finding rather than a gap — the client writes
  the drop once the base is already gone. Nothing is withheld behind a `+n more`:
  the tail was exactly the half a re-run is run for. The per-type detail comes
  from the destroy events, because the client's own counters are keyed by
  `ObjectType` and can only say "26 infantry, 10 buildings, 4 vehicles"; the
  cumulative curve is beside them.
- **Every loss total opens into units and buildings.** `40 LOST`, and the `40
  lost` in the statistics sentence, are one number over two very different facts
  — thirteen losses is a skirmish if they were infantry and a base if three were
  buildings — so a click puts `(30 UNITS · 10 BUILDINGS)` after it and a second
  click folds it back. **Both sides of a row open together**, since the header
  exists to be read across the clock. Each total splits from its **own** source:
  the sentence off the client's `byKind` counter, a block caption off the destroy
  events it counted, so a number and its parts can never disagree. The units
  figure keeps what the source knew — `26 infantry · 4 vehicles` — as its title.
  Collapsed by default and unchanged when collapsed; a harvest taken before the
  client was asked for the breakdown keeps a plain number rather than opening
  onto nothing. Nothing is stored: the state lives in the page, so a redraw folds
  it back.
- **What actually came out of the queues**, marked with a plus against the minus
  of a loss — the one number the file cannot be made to give up, since an order
  it records may have been cancelled, starved of credits or flushed when its
  factory died. Read against the orders above it, a delivery row is what says
  whether a build order was a plan or a wish. Same filter as the losses (an
  owner in this match), same grouping, and an object counted once however many
  times it spawns — a chrono-shifted tank leaves the map and comes back.
- **When a building was ready to place**, off the production queue's own status
  rather than the spawn events, because a building's spawn *is* its placement.
  This is the half of a structure's life the file cannot state: `PlaceBuilding`
  only does anything when the queue is already `Ready`, so a placement is the
  moment the player got round to it, and the `✓` above it is the moment the
  building was actually built.
- **A base standing up**, which is the one row on the axis that takes two
  sources to state, because each of them can only see half of it.

  A building appears because the player placed it, and the file records the
  placement — with exactly one exception: a Construction Yard from a deploying
  MCV is created by `DeployOrder`, so no `PlaceBuilding` stands behind it. So the
  re-run's test is the **pairing**, not the type: a building spawn a placement
  accounts for *is* that placement and draws nothing extra; one no placement
  accounts for gets a `<>` row of its own, in a violet nothing else on the page
  uses. One placement absorbs one spawn, nearest first and within two seconds —
  the two times are the same moment read off two clocks — and only its own
  owner's placements are candidates. **This is the only way to see a relocation
  or a second MCV**, because a mid-match deploy order in the file names no unit
  and cannot be told from a GI dropping sandbags.

  The **file** has the first one exactly, and needs no re-run at all. `OrderUnits`
  serialises `u8 orderType` first, and `OrderType.Deploy` / `DeploySelected` are
  9 and 10 — but an order carries no unit, and the selection before it is runtime
  object ids nothing in the file maps to a type. What settles it is the order of
  events: **a player cannot place a single building until their Construction Yard
  exists, and the first Construction Yard comes from the MCV deploying.** So a
  deploy order issued before that player's first placement is that MCV by
  construction, not by likelihood — no infantry has been built, no second vehicle
  bought, nothing else they own can deploy. What stood up is named from the
  player's country, which is in the file's own header and belongs to one side.

  Where both saw it they are one row and the re-run wins the second, since an
  order is an intent and a spawn is the outcome. Where the re-run missed it —
  and it misses the opening of most matches, see *the first seconds are not
  watched* below — the file's row is the whole of it. Like a capture this is
  **not gated with the deliveries**: turning that track off asks to stop being
  told which tanks came out, not to stop being told the base moved.
- **A building changing hands.** An engineer walking into a refinery moves a
  whole building from one side of the match to the other, and the file records
  only the order that sent him. A capture is **two rows at the same second** —
  `⇄ +Soviet Ore Refinery` in cyan on the side that took it, `⇄ −Soviet Ore
  Refinery` in dark orange on the side it came off — and one row when
  the building came off nobody in the match, a neutral oil derrick. The `⇄` is
  the kind of event and the `+`/`−` is which way it went; it was the word
  *captured* until 0.45.2, which made a capture the longest line in a column
  sized by its longest line, and it sat at the far end of the row until 0.46.2
  put every mark in front. **No loss
  number moves for one:** nothing was destroyed, so it is neither a loss nor a
  delivery, and the counters, the blocks, the split and the curve all stay where
  they were.

  It takes **two** of the client's events and only their pair means captured.
  `ObjectOwnerChange` names both sides but fires for everything that changes
  hands — mind control, a garrison emptying back to the civilians, docked units
  dragged along by their shipyard, a map trigger, and a defeated player's whole
  base going over in one flood at the second somebody resigns.
  `BuildingCapture` fires only for a capture and names only the building. So the
  last owner change per object is held and read when a capture arrives for that
  object **in the same tick** — same object and same tick both, or a capture
  inside a defeat flood would take its losing side from whatever moved just
  before it. Infantry garrisoning a civilian building is a different event again
  (`BuildingGarrison`) and draws nothing today.
- **Kills**, and who was **defeated**.
- **Credits** — what each side actually had, every five seconds. This replaces
  the ordered-value chart, which was a proxy for exactly this. In the fixture
  match it is the whole story: one side is flat broke from 1:20 while the other
  never drops below 3 000.

The mechanics, and why each piece is the way it is:

| piece | note |
|---|---|
| `src/replay-sim.js` | page-world, inert until the bridge hands it a job, and it refuses to run anywhere but a `#/replay/` route — this may never touch a live match |
| the turn loop | calls the client's own `doGameTurn` in 100 ms bursts, yielding through a `MessageChannel` rather than a timer, because a background tab clamps timers to a second |
| the destroy filter | **the owner is the whole filter** — the event bus reports 695 destroyed objects for this match, of which 44 belong to a player; the rest are projectiles, debris and the map's invisible markers |
| the spawn filter | the same one, plus an id seen once: `ObjectSpawn` fires again for an object that leaves the map and returns, and it was built one time |
| the roster | captured once at the start, because `getCombatants()` drops a player the moment they are defeated, which is exactly whose losses you were reading |
| `src/frames.js` | the frame pump — a run holds it for the client's *boot*, and gives it back the moment the match is playing (below) |
| `scripts/fixtures/sim-5a41749b.json` | a real harvest, committed, so `check-replay.mjs` can assert the merge without a browser |

It is also the most fragile thing in the extension: the parser only needs the
file format, while this needs the client's internals to keep their names.

**A re-run happens in a tab you are not looking at, and that used to be the
problem.** The turn loop was built for a hidden tab from the start — it breathes
through a `MessageChannel`, which is not throttled — but the client has to *boot*
before there is a match to play, and a boot advances from inside
`requestAnimationFrame`, which a hidden tab never calls. So the run sat waiting
for a match that was never going to start, for the five minutes it allows,
and came back with *timed out waiting for the match*.

`src/frames.js` is the answer: a content script at `document_start` (before the
client captures `requestAnimationFrame`, or the replacement would be one nothing
calls) that hands frames to the real one while the tab is visible and drives them
itself while it is not. It is **inert until a job holds it** — a tab you are
playing in has the browser's own frames and nothing else. The clock under it is a
worker's, because a worker's timers are not clamped with the page; where a page's
policy refuses a blob worker it falls back to a `MessageChannel` loop and says so
in the log. `node scripts/check-frames.mjs` drives the shipped file through both.

**The run tells the tab it is visible, holds the frames, and paces a long
match** — three parts of one thing, and it took five dead tabs to find the first.

`GameAnimationLoop` branches on `document.hidden` alone: hidden, it cancels its
`requestAnimationFrame` and runs a background frame off a one-second interval
that ticks the game and **calls the renderer not at all**. And the render layer
only retires itself inside that render update — a killed infantryman's renderable
waits on a promise resolved from `update()`, explosions, laser effects and smoke
trails all take themselves out of the scene there. So a match played out in a tab
the client believes is hidden creates renderables for every one of thirty
thousand ticks of combat and disposes of none of them, in canvases and three.js
geometry — memory `performance.memory` cannot see. That is a fact about the
client, and it was read out of its own code; whether it is *the* reason seven
tabs have died between ticks 31 344 and 31 909 of 32 130, while the measured heap
moved 68 MB against a 4192 MB ceiling, is a different question and an open one.

So a run spoofs `document.hidden` for its own tab and for its own duration, the
pump supplies the frames that make the claim true, and a match over 20 000 ticks
is paced at 240 ticks a second — the client's own ×16, the speed the same replay
was watched through at. `src/frames.js` reads the platform's own visibility
accessor rather than `document`, so the lie the client is told cannot fool the
pump that has to keep feeding it.

**And it is still not enough — the tab has to be one the browser really shows.**
With the spoof in place the client does render again (the heap grows 217 MB over
a match instead of 68, and the measured ticks per frame come out at three to
four, the watched configuration exactly) and the tab is lost anyway, at tick
31 909 of 32 130. The same run in a tab **the browser genuinely shows** plays the
match out — tick 32 092 of 32 130, 143 seconds, and the heap **ends where it
started**: 1073 MB after the boot, 1069 MB at the end, against +217 MB in every
hidden run. Seven hidden runs died between ticks 31 344 and 31 909; the first
visible one finished.

So telling the client the tab is visible is not the same as the tab being
visible: the frames it then draws are for a compositor that never takes them, and
whatever that costs is outside everything a page can measure — the JS heap was
flat through all of it, against a 4192 MB ceiling.

**Therefore a match over 20 000 ticks is re-run in front of you**, and the panel
says so when it starts one. Shorter matches — which have never failed hidden —
are left in the background. That threshold is the result of seven runs, and what
each of them ruled out is recorded in `src/replay-sim.js` beside the code it
decided.

**Two debug controls sit on the Replays tab**, because the rate and the tab's
visibility are what this failure turns on and both are better dialled than argued
about:

- *re-run at N ticks/s* — empty leaves the rule above, `0` means flat out
  whatever the length, anything else is held to exactly. 240 is the client's ×16;
  flat out reaches about 2700 on this machine.
- *Always run in a visible tab* — does for every match what a long one does
  anyway. Useful for finding where the boundary really is, since 20 000 ticks is
  drawn from one match that dies and several that do not.

Both are remembered, and the rate travels with the job; the run's opening log
line states the rate it actually used.

The pump **drops a backlog**: the clock keeps ticking while
the main thread is inside a 100 ms burst of turns, and delivering the six ticks
waiting afterwards would draw six frames back to back. The real
`requestAnimationFrame` delivers one callback per frame it actually produced, and
so does this.

The nudge is still there for the replay run, but it is now the fallback it was
meant to be: it tests **ticks** rather than that a tab picked the job up
(`started` is written a second after the tab opens, which is why the nudge on
this path used to be suppressed by the very state it was meant to catch), and it
waits the same 25 s as the render run — after a day of waiting 90. The longer
window was set on the reading that the pump makes a hidden boot work and the
nudge was cutting it short; the next cold run sat hidden for **ninety seconds
with no loading screen at all** and got there five seconds after the nudge
finally showed the tab, while a warm client had booted hidden in 10.9 s the run
before. The pump carries a warm boot; a cold one still wants the tab in front,
and 25 s is the number that fits both.

**A run that dies is written off.** The thing that writes *finished* is the tab
doing the run, so a tab that crashes leaves the button reading `re-running… 99%`
for ever and the match impossible to ask for again. A run now says it is alive
every 700 ms while playing and every three seconds while waiting for the client,
and the options page writes off one that has said nothing for `STALL_MS` — the
same rule a render run has always had. Two things keep it from getting that far:
the run stops itself if the match has not advanced a tick in 20 seconds, and on
memory — **measured from where the run started, not from zero**.

That distinction was bought the hard way. The same 9-minute match killed its tab
twice in a row, the second time reporting **1146 MB of heap** on its last write,
and it died at the same *tick* both times rather than after the same number of
seconds — with the client drawing the first time and not drawing the second. So
the growth is per tick and in the game's own logic. But an absolute stop set from
those numbers then killed a run **at tick 921 of 32 130**, because a cold client
boot had already reported 1087 MB before a turn was played, and most of a boot's
heap is garbage nobody has collected yet. A boot's cost says nothing about
whether a match can be played.

So a run takes a baseline when the match comes up — and says what it was — then
stops if it grows **600 MB** on top of it, or passes 1800 MB outright. Above
**250 MB** of growth it stops sprinting between bursts and waits 150 ms, which is
the only lever this side has on the possibility that the heap is mostly garbage a
loop this tight never lets the collector take. The share of Chrome's ceiling is
gone: the ceiling here is 4192 MB and the tab died at a quarter of it, so
whatever kills the tab is not that ceiling.

Every progress write carries the last sixty readings of the heap against the tick
they were taken at, so a run that dies anyway leaves the shape of the climb behind
it (`node scripts/read-storage.mjs sim`).

**And a run saves as it goes.** The harvest is handed over to be stored every
1.5 seconds — every half second through the last tenth of the match — under the
same match id a finished one uses. That is what a *checkpoint* is: the same rows,
minus what the match had not reached yet. It exists because the measurement above
found the deaths clustered in the **last 800 ticks of a 32 130-tick match**,
while the heap over the whole match before that grew 6 MB per thousand ticks — a
tab dying there used to take a report that was 97% written with it. A report
drawn from a checkpoint says what it covers (`re-run covers 97% of the match`)
rather than passing for a finished run.

**And the tab doing the harvest draws nothing of ours.** The preview and the
full-size render are for a human looking at a loading screen; in a run's tab they
are tens of megabytes decoded into the one place that cannot spare them, so
`src/companion.js` skips both while `__cdcSim.busy()`.

#### Two clocks, and which one a report prints

A match has two, and they are not the same number:

| | |
|---|---|
| **real time** | the tick divided by the rate the match was *played* at (`report.ticksPerSecond`, 60 on the ladder) — the wall clock, and what the ladder's own `duration` says. A ranked match of 32 130 ticks is 8:55, and the API reports 8 minutes. |
| **the game clock** | the same ticks at `GameSpeed.BASE_TICKS_PER_SECOND` — **15 a second, whatever speed the game runs at** — which is the clock the client draws in the corner while you watch. The same match reads **35:42** there. |

The report has always printed real time, and the game clock is the one a player
remembers a moment by: a run whose tab died showed *35:30* on screen while the
report called the same moment 8:51, and nothing tied the two together. So a
report offers **real time**, **game clock**, or **both** — printed `8:55
(35:42)`. The choice is kept: the options page in extension storage, the site in
`localStorage`. A match played at 15 ticks a second has one clock and is offered
no choice.

#### Export — and the same report on the site

**Export** writes the report on screen to a `.json` file. It is worth having
because of what is above: a re-run is the only source of losses, kills and
credits, and it needs the game client, which a web page does not have. So a
report that has been run is the only form in which those numbers reach anybody
else.

The companion site (`site/`) has a **Replays** page that reads both: a `.rpl`
dropped on it, or a report exported here. It runs *these* files —
`src/replay.js`, `src/replay-view.js` and `src/replay-view.css` are vendored into
the site's assets at build time, the way `src/glyphs.js` already was — so a
report drawn there cannot differ from the one drawn here. The object table and
the cameo sheet cannot be vendored, having no copy in `src/`: `site/export.mjs`
writes them into the site's assets straight out of the extension's harvest, and
refuses to build a site from a store that never got one. `src/replay-view.js` is where the renderer lives now; the options
page keeps only the panel around it.

What the site cannot do, and why:

| | the extension | the site |
|---|---|---|
| parse a `.rpl` you have | yes | yes — in the browser, nothing uploaded |
| **fetch** a replay by link or id | yes, through a host permission | **no** — `replays-*.chronodivide.com` sends no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and answers the preflight with 403 (measured 2026-08-16). The page lists your matches off the ladder API, which does send it, and links the file so the browser downloads it |
| re-run a match for losses and credits | yes | no, at any price — it needs the client |
| read a report somebody else re-ran | yes | yes, via the exported file |

Names come from the harvested object table: a replay names an object by its
**ordinal** in the rules type lists, nothing served over the network states those
lists, and the client that recorded the replay is the one that can. `node
scripts/check-replay.mjs` decodes a committed fixture against the table in
`scripts/fixtures/` and asserts the whole match — tiles included — because a
shape test would pass with every id off by one. The format itself — byte layout, enums and the tick rate — was read out of
the client's own `network/gameopt/Parser` and verified against eight ladder
replays; `src/replay.js` carries it.

### Sprite offsets

Terrain, ore borders and start blocks are placed by arithmetic read out of the
client. Sprites are not: the client positions them through 3D billboard geometry
that does not reduce to flat pixel maths, so what is left over is measured
against the running game, per sprite type — `SPRITE_FIX` at the top of
`src/hq-preview.js`. Fences sit low where trees sit high, so it is a table
rather than a constant.

What is in the source is the **shipped default**, and `spriteFix` in the
extension's storage overrides it — so a client update that moves sprites is
answered by re-measuring on the machine that noticed rather than by waiting for
a build.
Renders already stored keep the offsets they were drawn with: `RENDERER_VERSION`
stamps a build, not a number the user dials, so re-rendering is a deliberate act.

A few objects do not follow their type — `SPRITE_FIX_BY_NAME` keys a correction
to a single object name for those, and `__cdcHq.list()` prints the names on the
loaded map. Both tables are read by the render through the bridge, so a
measurement made on one machine reaches its renders without a build.

## Settings backup

**Everything that defines your keyboard, in one file, so a second browser does
not mean binding it all again.** The *Backup* tab reads it, saves it, and puts
it back somewhere else.

The reason it needs a feature at all is where the game keeps its own settings:

| what | where | reachable from |
|---|---|---|
| the game's hotkeys | `keyboard.ini` — `keyboardmd.ini` under Yuri's Revenge — at the root of the client's **origin-private file system** | a game tab only |
| the game's other options | `localStorage`, under `_r_*` keys | a game tab only |
| the extension's own bindings and notes | `chrome.storage` | the options page |

Origin-private and per-browser, both of the client's. There is no file on disk
to copy, and its hotkeys are **not** in the `_r_*` blob — that carries scroll
rate, the graphics preset, right-click move and scroll and mouse acceleration,
and nothing about keys. So a backup has to reach into the client's own file
system, which is what the game tab does on this tab's behalf.

### What travels, and what deliberately does not

Four tick boxes, and they govern the file in both directions — a backup holding
everything can be loaded for its hotkeys alone.

- **Game hotkeys** — the client's whole `[Hotkey]` table. Both engines' files
  when both exist, because which one the client is using depends on what was
  last played.
- **Other game options** — the `_r_*` settings the client's own options screens
  write, including the sound mixer and your preferred host options.
- **Extension bindings** — the number keys, the build hotkeys per side, the
  chord grids, and the tick boxes on *Settings*.
- **Map guides** — the per-map guides, which preview each map shows, and the
  start-position marks turned off. Not the sprite offsets: those are a
  measurement rather than a preference, and the table in `src/hq-preview.js`
  is what every install renders with.

**Left behind on purpose**, and the file says nothing about them because they
are not settings:

| key | why it stays |
|---|---|
| `_r_lastCon` | a live reconnect payload — imported elsewhere it makes *that* browser offer to rejoin a match it was never in |
| `_r_gameRes` | where this install takes its game files from: a fact about the browser |
| `_r_last_gpu` | measured on this machine's GPU. Carrying it suppresses the graphics prompt on a machine that needed to be asked |
| `_r_nickname`, `_r_autoLogin`, `_r_region` | identity, not settings |
| `_r_last*` | lobby state — the map, mode, country and colour last picked |

Renders, map cards, the cameo sheet and re-run matches are absent as well: they
are megabytes of pictures the other browser builds for itself.

### Reading, and putting it back

Reading the client's half needs a game tab, so one is opened — inactive and
muted — if none is listening, exactly as a render run does, and closed again
when it answers. The file is JSON with a `readable` block written next to the
codes:

```json
"game": { "hotkeys": { "keyboard.ini": { "Options": 1094 } } },
"readable": { "keyboard.ini": { "Options": "Alt+F" } }
```

`readable` is for the person carrying the file. It is written on the way out and
**ignored on the way in**, so editing it changes nothing rather than quietly
disagreeing with the code beside it.

An import writes through the client's own objects where there are any — its live
hotkey table, then its own serialiser — so the keys in play and the file on disk
cannot end up disagreeing, and the hotkeys need no reload. Where there is no
client yet, which is the fresh-browser case this exists for, the file is written
directly and the tab is told to reload. The `_r_*` settings always want a reload:
the client reads them once at start-up, and its own options screen writes its
copy back over yours when you leave it.

**What was there before is kept.** The snapshot is taken by the same tab that is
about to overwrite it, a moment before it does, so *Undo the last import* puts
back what was actually there rather than what this page last happened to read.
It outlives the page, because an import that reloads the game tab is one you may
want to undo minutes later.

### The one thing an import cannot promise

A backup names commands, and the client it lands on decides what a command is
called. A newer client that has renamed one has no place to put that line — so
it is **named in the report and not written**, rather than dropped in silence or
written back as a name the client will warn about on every boot. Everything the
client does recognise still lands. Anything that is not one of the two hotkey
file names, or is a `_r_*` key outside the list above, is refused outright: a
file picker will hand over anything at all.

## Status

Early. Every measured claim in this README gives its number and the date it was
taken; anything stated without one is a design intention rather than a
measurement.

## Not affiliated, and what is whose

This is an unofficial browser extension. It is **not affiliated with, endorsed
by, or connected to** Chrono Divide or Electronic Arts, and neither has reviewed
it. *Chrono Divide*, *Command & Conquer*, *Red Alert* and every other name and
mark here belong to their respective owners; they are used only to say what this
works with.

The MIT licence in `LICENSE` covers the code in this repository. **The game's
artwork is not in it** and never was licensed to be: the cameo sheet a build
order is drawn with is **harvested from your own client at runtime** and kept in
the extension's storage. The **Harvest cameos** button on the Replays tab is that
run asked for by hand, and `scripts/probe-cameo-harvest.js` is how you check what
it found against your own client. A report is therefore drawn with art you
already have.

What the repository does carry about the game is **facts, not artwork**: object
ids, names, costs and cell numbers, in `src/replay-types.js` and under
`scripts/fixtures/`. They are values from a game you are expected to own a copy
of, and there is no artwork among them — the sheet in the fixtures is a 1×1
transparent placeholder.

`src/replay-types.js` is a **bootstrap, not the authority.** The object table
harvested from your own client is installed over it as soon as one exists, and
that one is the better source: the client layers `rulescd.ini` over `rules.ini`,
so its values are the ones actually in play. The committed copy exists so a
profile that has never harvested does not read `building #12` for every row of
its first report. `node scripts/fixture-replay-types.mjs` rebuilds both it and
the fixtures from your own client's tables, so `git diff` is the comparison
between them. Nothing here redistributes the game.

## Compatibility

Written against client **v0.83.3**. The hooks depend on internal module names,
React prop shapes and CSS class names — all of which the CD team can change
without notice. Run `__cdc.probe()` in the devtools console (page context)
while a loading screen is up: it re-checks every assumption and prints which
ones still hold.
