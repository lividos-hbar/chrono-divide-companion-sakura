/**
 * What a ladder replay says, without a client.
 *
 * A `.rpl` is a text file: three header lines, then one line per game tick that
 * carried anything — `<tick>=<eventType>|<base64>` — and `END <tick>`. The
 * base64 is the same action frame the client sends over the wire each network
 * turn, so a replay is a complete record of what every player *did*: what they
 * queued, what they placed and where, what they sold, when they resigned.
 *
 * That makes a build order a file parse. The alternative — booting the client at
 * `#/replay/<url>` and reading the live objects ([[live-radar-and-automation]])
 * — is the only way to learn what the actions *resulted in* (credits, kills,
 * what a queue actually finished), and it costs a game load per replay. This
 * file deliberately does the cheap half, and says so where the difference bites:
 * a queued unit is an intent, a placed building is a fact.
 *
 * Byte layout, enums and the tick rate were read out of the client's own
 * `network/gameopt/Parser` and verified against eight ladder replays on
 * 2026-08-16.
 *
 * No DOM, no chrome APIs, no storage — so `scripts/check-replay.mjs` runs this
 * very file under node against a fixture. A copy of the logic in the check would
 * pass while the shipped file was broken.

   * It is deliberately the **fastest possible** queue: production here never runs
   * out of credits, never loses power, never loses a factory. Its occupancy is
   * therefore a floor under the real one, and the error only ever runs in the
   * direction that credits the player — every overclick it reports is certain,
   * every accepted order is an upper bound. What it cannot see at all is
   * `ensurePrerequisites`, which empties a whole queue when its factory dies;
   * `STALE_SECONDS` is what keeps that from poisoning everything after it.
   *
   * That floor points one way, and only `add` may read it. A queue already full
   * in the fastest possible model is certainly full in the real one, so a refused
   * add is a fact. A **cancel** the model cannot cover is the same floor read
   * backwards and states nothing at all: the real queue held at least as much as
   * this one and may well have absorbed the whole cancel. So `cancel` reports no
   * shortfall — for a while it did, and 79 of the 82 "overclicks" on a four
   * minute match were players emptying their queues.
   *
   * Returns `null` when the generated rules are not loaded, and the caller then
   * says so rather than presenting unclamped orders as if they had been checked.

   *   not split arbitrarily, so a loss chains. A delivery must not: chaining is
   *   what let a factory's whole run fold into a row printed at the second the
   *   first one appeared, and a row measured from its start can never claim a
   *   span wider than its window.

     * nor the placement states.

     * That is true of every building a player *puts down*, and false for exactly
     * one case: a Construction Yard from a deploying MCV is created by
     * `DeployOrder`, so no `PlaceBuilding` action stands behind it. Dropping

     * standing up, whether it is the first one, a relocation or a second MCV, is
     * one of the few moves that changes everything about a match's geography.

     * no placement accounts for is a deploy. Reading the file's *deploy orders*

     * outcome (a blocked deploy is a `DeployNotAllowedEvent`), and `Deploy` is
     * also what a GI does dozens of times a match, with nothing in the file
     * saying which selected unit the order was for.

     * One placement absorbs one spawn, nearest first, so a player who put down
     * two of the same building does not have one of them account for both.
