/**
 * The player recolour, exercised without a browser, a client or a match.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-colours.mjs
 *
 * The feature is one assignment — `player.color = rules.colors.get(name)` — and
 * everything that can go wrong with it is in deciding *which* name, which is
 * invisible until four people are in a lobby. So the section is sliced out of
 * `src/companion.js` and run here against a stub game: the trick
 * `check-net.mjs` uses on the net readout, for the same reason.
 *
 * What is worth checking:
 *
 *   - **the ordinals**, because they are the whole difference between this and
 *     "paint every enemy red". A blank row must hold its place: if the counter
 *     skipped it, every row below would mean a different opponent depending on
 *     what the rows above happened to say;
 *   - **only names the client has** — a colour is legal exactly when the rules
 *     define it, because a batched voxel builder resolves its palette by
 *     content hash against a list precomputed from `rules.colors` and throws
 *     inside the render loop when it misses. An invented colour is a crash, not
 *     a red, so the section is asserted never to construct one;
 *   - **the loading screen's different world** — no Player objects, no
 *     alliances, and a "self" that is a guess from the country and may be
 *     nobody. With no self there is no enemy either, and the screen must be
 *     left alone rather than painted from a guess;
 *   - **the wire**, because the harvested table crosses two files by a message
 *     type that is a string on both sides.
 *
 * What is NOT checked here is whether the client still exposes `Game#init`,
 * `Alliances#areAllied` or `rules.colors` — that needs the real bundle, and
 * `__cdc.probe()` answers it in the tab.
