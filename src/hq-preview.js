/**
 * Companion for Chrono Divide — full map render.
 *
 * The preview shipped inside a map file ([PreviewPack]) is a couple of pixels
 * per cell, so no amount of upscaling makes a cell readable. This renders the
 * map from its own cell data through the client's own art — terrain tiles, ore,
 * walls, bridges, trees, smudges and structures — the way the map renders posted
 * around the community are made.
 *
 * Everything below uses the client's decoders rather than reimplementing a
 * format; the module names and call shapes below are quoted from the client's
 * own bundle, read at v0.83.3.
 *
 *   Engine.loadTheater(type)    -> Theater { tileSets, palettes }
 *   new GameMap(mapFile, …)     -> TileCollection, with the engine's LAT smoothing
 *   TmpDrawable#draw(img, w, h) -> palette indices for one terrain tile
 *   new Rules / new Art         -> what an object is called, which SHP it draws as
 *   ImageFinder                 -> art name + theater -> ShpFile
 *
 * Geometry. TMP pixel space is also the client's screen space
 * (IsoCoords.screenTileToScreen: x = dx·30, y = dy·15, one height level = 15px
 * up), so a cell's diamond has its top-left bounding corner at
 * (dx·30, dy·15 − z·15), and an SHP's own canvas is centred on that cell.
 * That last part is checked against the running game rather than derived: the
 * client places sprites through 3D billboard geometry that does not reduce to
 * flat pixel arithmetic, and reproducing its MapSpriteTranslation offsets here
 * moved every object off its cell. What is left over per sprite type is
 * SPRITE_FIX below — measured, not calculated. `tune` nudges every pass at once.
 *
 * Marks. Everything drawn on top of the art — harvest fields, spawn blocks,
 * building outlines and the thumbnail's pictograms — comes in two styles
 * (MARK_STYLES). The full render is zoomed into and gets marks traced on true
 * cells; the thumbnail is 400px of a 150-cell map and gets a vocabulary that
 * survives three pixels per cell.
 *
 * companion.js renders each map once as it loads and stores the result; from the
 * console, __cdcHq.render() draws whatever map is loaded and __cdcHq.sample()
 * captures it split into per-type layers for the options page's alignment panel.

  /**
   * What a render *looks like*, as a number. Bump it whenever a change makes an
   * already-stored render out of date — new marks, moved sprites, a different
   * crop, a different set of sizes asked for in companion.js.
   *
   * It is stamped onto every stored render, which is the only thing that makes
   * "which of these are behind" answerable without looking at them. Two things
   * read it: the auto-render stops treating a stale render as "already stored",
   * and a bulk run redoes exactly the ones that are behind.
   *
   * Deliberately hand-maintained rather than derived from the extension version:
   * most releases do not change a pixel, and a stamp that moved every release
   * would mark the whole catalogue stale for nothing.
   *
   * 1 — the first stored renders.
   * 2 — outlines under the buildings; the thumbnail's own compact marks
   *     (2026-08-07, [[map-preview-hq]] rounds 4 and 4a).
   * 3 — scenery stopped being marked as a player's building: the gate is
   *     capturable-or-handed-over, not owned (2026-08-08, iconFor).
   * 4 — the droplet, parachute and wrench redrawn (2026-08-09, ICON_GLYPHS).
   *     Every stored render of a map with a tech building differs.
   * 5 — CAOUTP is a repair depot, not a free vehicle: it takes the wrench and
   *     the tank glyph is gone (2026-08-09, BUILDING_ICONS).
   * 6 — the full render marks tech buildings with a pictogram above them, not
   *     an outline alone; the parachute and wrench are drawn half again as big
   *     at both sizes; the droplet's bowl sank and its tail thinned
   *     (2026-08-09, MARK_STYLES.detail, ICON_SCALE, ICON_GLYPHS).
   * 7 — the full render stopped baking those badges in: it hands their
   *     placements back and whoever shows it draws them, so they can be
   *     switched off without re-rendering (2026-08-09, result.icons).
   * 8 — the offsets dialled on one machine became the shipped table: buildings
   *     at −14 rather than the shared −13, and the tech airport at −16 of its
   *     own (2026-08-21, SPRITE_FIX and SPRITE_FIX_BY_NAME). Every stored
   *     render holding a building was drawn with the old number and stands a
   *     pixel high; the airport stands three. Visible enough to be reported
   *     from a card, which is what moved this.
   * 9 — a per-object correction replaces its type's instead of adding to it
   *     (2026-08-21, queue). The panel dials a named layer from zero, so its
   *     number was already the whole correction; added, the building offset was
   *     counted twice and every airport drew half a cell high. Only maps with

   * for all three, three ways over: it layers `rulescd.ini` on top of
   * `rules.ini`, so its values are the ones actually in play where an
   * RA2-derived table would disagree wherever Chrono Divide changed something;
   * it cannot go stale against a client update the way a committed file did;
   * and `rulesOnly` is already here, so it costs no new dependency and no
   * second parse of rules.ini.
   *
   * **Three filters, and they are the client's own**, taken from
   * `Production#isAvailableForProduction`: `techLevel === -1` is how the rules
   * mark a thing that is never buildable, `BuildLimit=0` is how they mark one
   * only the AI may have, and an empty `Owner` is a civilian or scenery object
   * that belongs to no country. What is left is what a human can be given to
   * build in some match — which is the question a key binding asks.
   *
   * What this deliberately does **not** answer is whether a thing can be built
   * *now*: prerequisites, factories and tech level at this moment are
   * `production.getAvailableObjects()` in a running match, and the press asks
   * the client rather than this table. A binding outlives a match; availability
   * does not.
   *
   * Names and costs are not returned either — `objectTypes` below harvests
   * both for every object here, keyed by the ordinal a replay names, and the
   * options page already loads that table for the replay views. `owner` is raw
   * for the same reason: the country -> side table is companion.js's
   * `FACTIONS`, which is what every other faction label in the extension comes
   * from.

   * Every cameo this client can draw, as one sheet and an id -> cell map.
   *
   * The shape `src/cameos.js` used to publish as `window.__cdcCameos`, built
   * from the player's own client instead of from the author's Red Alert 2
   * install. That is the entire point, and why that file is gone: EA never
   * licensed RA2's artwork for redistribution, so the committed sheet was 190 KB
   * nobody here had the right to ship. Harvested at runtime the pixels never
   * enter the repo, and they are the player's own localisation rather than the
   * Russian one baked into the install the committed sheet came out of.
   *
   * **`Cameo=` is art, not rules.** Measured against the live client
   * (`scripts/probe-cameo-harvest.js`, 2026-08-20): `art.getObject(id).cameo`
   * answered for 97 of 97 technos and `rules.sidebarImage` for none of them,
   * while `sidebarImage` answered for all seven superweapons. The two are
   * different mechanisms rather than fallbacks for one another, which is why
   * this reads each from its own place instead of trying one and then the other.
   *
   * **Unfiltered, unlike `roster()` above.** That one applies the client's three
   * buildability tests because a key binding asks what a player may build. A
   * cameo answers a different question — what a *replay* may name — and a replay
   * names objects no one can build: things delivered rather than ordered, and
   * things a mission gave someone. Measured on the same probe run: the filtered
   * walk finds 87 objects with pictures, where the committed sheet names 99 —
   * so the filters cost ids a replay can put on a timeline.
   *
   * Aliases are the normal case, not an edge one: two ids frequently share one
   * picture (a Chrono Sphere and its warp, a construction yard and its MCV), so
   * cells are keyed by picture name and the index points many ids at one cell.
   *
   * One id failing costs that id and nothing else — a missing SHP is recorded
   * and the walk goes on, because the sheet is worth having 99% complete and
   * unavailable is worth nothing. A harvest that draws *nothing* is a failure
   * and says so.

  /**
   * What a map holds, as a few kilobytes that outlive the client.
   *
   * The renderer walks every object on every map it draws and then throws the
   * walk away, keeping only the picture — so "does this map have airports" could
   * be answered by the extension only by looking at a 3000px PNG, or not at all.
   * A picture is not an index.
   *
   * This is the same walk with nothing drawn: no theater, no sprites, no canvas.
   * It is stored beside the catalogue card (`maps[key].objects`), so every
   * question about a map's contents is answerable later from storage alone, with
   * no game tab and no engine — which is the whole point, since the engine is
   * reachable only inside a page that has the client on it.
   *
   * **Counts, not coordinates**, for everything but structures: a map carries
   * thousands of ore cells and their positions are the picture's job, while
   * their *presence* is the fact worth keeping. Structures are few and each one
   * is a different fact (who owns it, how it got that way), so they are kept
   * grouped by kind the way `list()` prints them.
   *
   * The state it describes is the map file as loaded — the start of a match.
