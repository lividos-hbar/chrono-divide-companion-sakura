  /**
   * The four sidebar sections, and the client command that reaches each one.
   *
   * A chord's prefix is **not** hardcoded to q/w/e/r. The client has its own
   * commands for the four sidebar tabs and `state.clientHotkeys` already carries
   * their live bindings (see the KeyBinds hook), so the prefix is read from
   * there: the first press is the client's own tab switch, unswallowed and
   * unchanged, and the second press within the window opens our grid for the
   * tab that press just switched to. The two can therefore never disagree, and a
   * player who rebinds the tabs gets their chords moved with them.
   *
   * `fallback` is only for a tab the client's table has not been seen to bind —
   * before the first match the table is empty, and RA2's own keyboard.ini puts
   * these four on q/w/e/r.
   *
   * `queue` names the production queue whose *readiness* blocks the section. It
   * is set only for the two building queues: `QueueStatus.Ready` happens when a
   * structure is waiting to be placed, and both of those queues hold one item,
   * so a ready structure blocks the whole section. Units leave their factory on
   * their own and their queues are never Ready.
   *
   * `queues` is the other half of that fact and a longer list: every queue the
   * tab can put something into, which is what a Ctrl press on the tab key
   * cancels out of. A tab is **not** a queue — the Units tab alone feeds
   * Vehicles, Ships and Aircraft — so the press picks one of them
   * (`chordCancelQueue`) rather than assuming the tab has only ever meant one.

   *   right one on the key. See `chordIsDeck`.

   * **Both sides are the player's own grids**, adopted as they were played:
   * the Soviet one in 0.56.0, the Allied one in 0.57.0 after a season of
   * actually pressing it. That is the rule the layouts answer to, and it
   * outranks the two rules that came before it — tech order, then the mirror —
   * because it is the only one with evidence behind it.
   *
   * The mirror is what is *left* of the second rule, and it is worth keeping in
   * mind because it still holds where the two rosters do the same jobs:
   *
   * - the structures opening — power, barracks, refinery, war factory, radar on
   *   `q w e r t`, both sides;
   * - `q` the miner, `w` the main tank, `e` the anti-air on both units grids;
   * - the country key, `d` on infantry and `f` on units, both sides;
   * - the sea on `zxcvb`, both sides.
   *
   * And it is broken on purpose where the hand disagreed with it. The units
   * grids swap two keys against each other — the Allied `t` is the plane and
   * `d` the artillery, the Soviet `t` the artillery and `d` the plane — and the
   * Allied infantry grid is sorted by its own logic entirely: `r` the Rocketeer
   * and `t` the Spy, then the Chrono Legionnaire, Tanya and the Chrono Commando
   * on `a` `s` `f`. Neither is drift. A key that gets pressed under pressure is
   * worth more than a key that reads well in a table, and where the two rosters
   * genuinely do not line up — no Allied Terror Drone, no Soviet Chrono
   * Legionnaire — there was never a mirror to keep.
   *
   * The three rows are still the grouping:
   *
   * - **`qwert` — what you build every match.** Power, barracks, refinery, war
   *   factory then radar on structures; the miner, the main tank and the
   *   anti-air on units; the turrets and the wall on defence.
   * - **`asdfg` — the late and the expensive.** Battle lab, superweapons, MCV,
   *   heavy tank, the heroes. `g` ends the section, and the **shipyard sits
   *   there** rather than at its tech level: it is the one building a land map
   *   makes pointless, so it is off the run pressed every game. The defence
   *   grid's `g` is the same idea taken further — the paradrop off a **captured**
   *   tech airport, which most matches never hand you at all, on the same key
   *   for both sides.
   * - **`zxcvb` on the units grid is the sea** — all five keys, attack ship,
   *   transport and capital ship on the same three of them. Nothing that floats
   *   sits above it and nothing else sits in it.
   *
   * **The country slot ends its group** rather than sitting on `b`: `d` on the
   * infantry grid, after the specialists and before the heroes, and `f` on the
   * units grid, after the land block. `b` was your country's key on every grid
   * until the sea took the bottom row. The French Grand Cannon is the exception
   * and barely one — it is a turret, so it is with the turrets.
   *
   * Where the two rosters do not line up the Allies simply run longer: they
   * have a SpySat Uplink and a Grand Cannon the Soviets have no answer to, and
   * no second power plant, so their defence grid reaches `f` and their
   * structures grid leaves `f` empty.
   *
   * `null` is an empty slot, and empty slots keep their key: the grid's geometry
   * is the keyboard's, so a missing object must not move the ones after it.
   *
   * **Which grid a building is on is not a choice**: `BuildCat=Combat` sends it
   * to the Armory queue — the Defence tab — which is why the superweapons, the
   * Gap Generator, the SpySat Uplink and the Psychic Sensor are on `ww`.
   *
   * Overridden per side from the options page; this is what a fresh install
   * plays with, and what *Reset section* puts back.

   *   is left alone entirely rather than queueing something into a tab that is
   *   already going.

   *   the client itself tears down its keydown listener while it is up
   *   (`WorldInteraction#setEnabled(false)`), so a key that still reached our
   *   layers would be the one thing acting on a screen nobody is playing.
   *   Above the grid, because that is what modal means.
   * - **`grid`** — an open grid owns the keyboard. It owns Ctrl too now, which
   *   is why the cancel key no longer sits above it.
   * - **`cancelSection`** — Alt on a sidebar tab key with no grid open: pause or
   *   cancel what that tab is building. Bare Alt only; Ctrl+Alt is AltGr on a
   *   non-US layout and means neither.
   * - **`pass`** — none of the build layers; the listener goes on to the
   *   fullscreen swap and the configured hotkeys, which have their own rules and
   *   their own guards on Meta.
   *
   * @param {{code, ctrlKey, altKey, shiftKey, metaKey, repeat}} e

  /**
   * What a keypress means to the client's own in-game menu.
   *
   * The menu is the screen `Escape` opens in a match — Options, Fullscreen,
   * **Abort Mission**, Resume Mission — and the client reaches it through one
   * command, `KeyCommandType.Options`, which its `KeyBinds` table has on
   * keyCode 27 because RA2's own `keyboard.ini` put it there. Two things follow
   * from that, and both are why this table exists rather than a pair of `if`s in
   * the listener:
   *
   * 1. **Escape mid-match is one keystroke from quitting**, and it is the key a
   *    hand reaches for to cancel a placement or clear a selection. Ticked, the
   *    key the client has on `Options` is swallowed and a key of ours opens the
   *    menu deliberately.
   * 2. **The client cannot close the menu from the keyboard at all.** Opening it
   *    disables `WorldInteraction`, which *removes* the client's own keydown
   *    listener — so with the menu up, no key reaches the client, Escape
   *    included, and Resume Mission is a mouse click or nothing. Ours is the
   *    only listener still standing, which is what makes the second half
   *    possible.
   *
   * `isOptionsKey` is the live answer to what opens the menu, not the assumption
   * that it is Escape: the client's table is read through `KeyBinds#addHotKey`,
   * so a player who moved `Options` in the client's own key settings gets *that*
   * key swallowed and Escape left alone.
   *
   * **`inMatch` gates opening, and that is a fix rather than a tidy-up (0.73.1).**
   * A match ends with `GameScreen#onGameEnd` calling `playerUi.dispose()` — which
   * disposes the `WorldInteraction` and so **removes the client's own keydown
   * listener** — and only navigating away from the game screen five seconds
   * later; the `GameMenu` itself is disposed later still, in `onLeave`. In that
   * window the client's own Escape is already dead while ours is not, so an
   * ungated key opened the menu onto a screen the client had finished with:

   *   quit confirmation): one step back, not all the way out. A player who
   *   pressed Escape in a confirmation dialog meant that dialog.
   * - **`swallow`** — the client's `Options` key with no menu open. Nothing
   *   happens, which is the whole feature.

   * What a keypress means while a grid is open.
   *
   * Pure, and here rather than in the keydown listener, because it is a decision
   * table and it got one row wrong: 0.54.0 closed the grid for every key it did
   * not recognise, and a bare `Shift` is a key it does not recognise — so the
   * grid shut on the way to every shifted order, which made the Shift rule
   * unreachable from the grid it was written for.
   *
   * `consume` is separate from the action on purpose. An unknown key closes the
   * grid but is **not** swallowed: it was meant for the game, and the game
   * should get it. Escape and Control are swallowed, because closing is what
   * they were pressed for.
   *
   * **`place` is the tab key keeping its meaning while the grid is open.** A
   * grid opened on a queue that was still building is still up when the building
   * finishes, and at that moment every slot on it is dead — a ready queue takes
   * nothing else until the structure is on the ground. So the section's own tab
   * key does there what it does with no grid open (`openChord`): it hands the
   * finished building to placement. It costs no slot, because the slot it sits
   * on could not be ordered anyway while the queue is ready.
   *
   * `at` is the live half the caller supplies — which key opened this grid, and
   * whether that section's queue is holding a finished structure right now.
   * Without it the table behaves as it did before.
   *
   * **Alt on a slot key is that slot's cancel** (0.62.0) — the right click the
   * tile already had, reached by the hand that is already on the block. It
   * follows the *key* rule rather than the mouse one (`chordCancelAction`:
   * pause first, cancel on the second press), because that is what the other
   * cancel key on this feature does and two cancels that disagreed about the
   * first press would be two rules to remember. Alt on anything that is **not**
   * a slot is still the game's.

   * A box in the client's canvas pixels, in the viewport pixels an overlay uses.
   *
   * The two spaces are not the same and the difference is not the device pixel
   * ratio. The client sizes its canvas `Math.max(800, min(innerWidth, cfg))` —
   * so a window narrower or shorter than 800x600 gets a canvas **larger than
   * its own box**, which the browser then scales down to fit. `rect.width /
   * canvas.width` is that factor, it is 1 for every window big enough, and it
   * is the whole of what "handle scaling" means here: browser zoom, a resized
   * window and a fullscreen toggle all arrive as a different rect, a different
   * canvas size, or both.
   *
   * `scale` is the smaller of the two axes, for anything sized rather than
   * placed — a badge's text has one size and the box may be scaled unevenly.
   *
