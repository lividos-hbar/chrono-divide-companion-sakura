/**
 * Companion for Chrono Divide — loading-screen overlay.
 *
 * Runs in the page's MAIN world (see manifest.json), because everything here
 * needs either React fibers on the client's own nodes or the page's SystemJS
 * registry. An isolated content script can reach neither.
 *
 * What the client gives us, verified against v0.83.3 by reading the client's
 * own bundle:
 *   - the loading screen is React DOM: .loading-screen > .player-status-container
 *     > .player-status, each row with .player-country-icon and .player-name;
 *   - the country per player is in props, NOT in the DOM — the flag <img> src is
 *     a base64 data URL, so the only way to name a faction is the fiber;
 *   - MapFile decodes the map's own preview, and MapPreviewRenderer knows how to
 *     put numbered start locations on it. Both are reused rather than rewritten.

  /**
   * The keyboard lock — the mechanism a fullscreen game uses to keep Ctrl+W,
   * which is the user's own observation and it is right: `navigator.keyboard`
   * hands the page every key **while the document is fullscreen**, browser
   * shortcuts included.
   *
   * **There is one lock per page, and the client is already using it.** That is
   * the correction 0.60.1 is: `keyboard.lock(codes)` *replaces* the locked set
   * rather than adding to it, and the client locks `Escape, F5, F12, F11` on
   * entering fullscreen — `onFullScreenChange` — precisely so that Escape
   * reaches the game instead of leaving fullscreen. Locking our four tab keys
   * released that. The next Escape then left fullscreen, **and leaving
   * fullscreen ends the lock altogether**, so Ctrl+W went back to closing the
   * tab: the feature worked exactly until the first Escape, with nothing to see
   * in between.
   *
   * So neither side calls the API directly any more. `hookKeyboard` wraps it,
   * every request — the client's and ours — is recorded, and what actually goes
   * out is the union (`chordKeyLockPlan`). Nobody can take anybody's keys away.
   *
   * Two things still bound what we ask for, and both are deliberate:
   *
   * - **Only in a match, and only in the game's own fullscreen.** `F11` browser
   *   fullscreen leaves `document.fullscreenElement` null and the lock inert,
   *   which is a caveat rather than a bug: the API is defined against the
   *   Fullscreen API's element, and the client has its own button.
   * - **Off by preference.** Someone who closes tabs with Ctrl+W and means it
   *   turns this off, and Ctrl+W then does what it always did — while the
   *   client's own Escape lock, which is none of our business, stays untouched.
   *   What they give up since 0.70.0 is "queue next" on the grid's `w` and `t`
   *   slots; every other slot keeps it.
   *
   * **What is asked for moved in 0.70.0 and the reason did not.** The lock was
   * held for the four sidebar tab keys, because the cancel key was Ctrl and one
   * of the tabs is `w`. The cancel is on Alt now, which the browser does not
   * reserve — but Ctrl became "queue next" over the whole chord grid, whose
   * second and fifth slots are `w` and `t`. So the same two codes are held for
   * the opposite command, and `ctrlKeysToHold` derives them from the keys we
   * actually take a Ctrl on rather than naming them.

   * One hook is the whole capture, because the `PingMonitor` instance carries
   * the other two objects worth reading:
   *
   *   - **RTT** — `onNewSample`, an IRC ping to the game server, and `avgPing`
   *     is the client's own median over the match. A reservoir sample of 100,
   *     so it is the median of a sample of the match, not of all of it.
   *   - **LAT** — `gameTurnMgr` is the `LockstepManager`, and the gap between
   *     `onActionsSent` and `onActionsReceived` for one network turn is how long
   *     an order of yours takes to come back. That is the number that decides
   *     how a press feels; RTT only says how far away the server is.
   *   - **lag** — `onLagStateChange`, the client's own "waiting for the other
   *     clients" state, raised once a turn has been stuck past its threshold.
   *   - **the rate** — `networkTurnMillis` against `gameTurnMillis`: the server
   *     stretches the network turn to the slowest player, so this is where the
   *     cost of somebody else's connection shows up.
   *
   * FPS is the one number that is ours rather than the client's:
   * `renderer.getStats()` exists only while the client's panel is up, so this
   * counts its own frames on the same rAF instead of reading the widget.
   *
   * Per-player ping comes from somewhere else entirely and is read **passively**
   * — see `attachNet`.
