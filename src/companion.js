/**
 * Companion for Chrono Divide — loading-screen overlay.
 *
 * Runs in the page's MAIN world (see manifest.json), because everything here
 * needs either React fibers on the client's own nodes or the page's SystemJS
 * registry. An isolated content script can reach neither.
 *
 * What the client gives us, verified against v0.83.3 by reading the client's
 * own bundle:
 *   - the loading screen is React DOM: .loading-screen > .player-status-container
 *     > .player-status, each row with .player-country-icon and .player-name;
 *   - the country per player is in props, NOT in the DOM — the flag <img> src is
 *     a base64 data URL, so the only way to name a faction is the fiber;
 *   - MapFile decodes the map's own preview, and MapPreviewRenderer knows how to
 *     put numbered start locations on it. Both are reused rather than rewritten.

   * the panel's outer height, so the bar comes off it here.

   * The conversion is deliberately `height - bar` and not `height - bar - border`:

   * nothing jumps on upgrade. The stage then measures two pixels (the panel's
   * border) under the converted number until the next drag re-measures it.
   *
   * `ax` is the marker of the second: a value without it stores an absolute
   * `left`/`top`, and is converted to the anchor nearest each edge. The two are
   * independent fields and compose, so a layout written before either change
   * passes through both on one read.

  // `isShrouded(t)` is literally `getShroudType(t) === 0`.
  //
  // **Both masks mirror the live shroud; neither accumulates.** `seen` used to
  // be append-only, on the belief that the client's shroud answers "lit now"
  // and that this mask was what turned it into "has ever been seen". That
  // belief was wrong, and it was the bug. Sight writes `Explored` permanently,
  // so the client already answers "has ever been seen" -- the mask spent its
  // existence turning a persistent answer into the same persistent answer,
  // while the one thing it could not represent was the thing that mattered.
  //
  // Three paths revoke a reveal: `unrevealAround` outright, a temporary reveal
  // running out, and an enemy Gap Generator, which calls `unrevealAround` on
  // every non-allied shroud on a ~5 s refresh. An append-only mask shows none
  // of them -- a Spy Satellite dying left the map lit for ever.
  //
  // Mirroring reproduces all three and costs no special case, because the
  // temporary-reveal path is self-limiting: it only ever reverts tiles it had
  // itself promoted *from* `Unexplored`, so ground genuinely scouted survives
  // losing the satellite, exactly as RA2 does. All three read out of
  // `game/map/MapShroud` and `game/gameobject/trait/GapGeneratorTrait` at
  // v0.83.3.

  // previews -- and the one layer here whose colour is a live setting rather
  // than a baked one.
  //
  // **Read from the match, not from the map file.** This used to walk
  // `mapFile.overlays`, which is the ore the map *starts* with: a field mined
  // flat by hour two stayed on the radar for the rest of the game, and ore that
  // regrew from a drill never appeared at all. The live source is the client's
  // own, out of `MinimapModel` at v0.83.3 -- `tileOccupation.getObjectsOnTile`,
  // then an object that is an overlay and answers `isTiberium()`. Ore and gems
  // are told apart by `overlayId`, which is the SAME id space the map file uses
  // (`Overlay#isTiberium` is itself a lookup on it), so `__cdcHq.oreKindFor`
  // classifies a running match with the ranges that already classify a stored
  // map. One table, no drift.
  //
  // **Why the marks are not simply in the picture.** They are, on a stored
  // preview: `drawOreFields` fills each patch into the render's `marks` surface
  // at the colour in force when it ran. That is right for a picture written to
  // disk and wrong for this one -- the radar takes **one** layered render per
  // map and keeps it for the whole match, so a tint baked into it would be a
  // colour that could not change without a re-render measured in seconds, in
  // the middle of a game. The radar's own source is rendered `annotate: false`
  // for exactly that reason.
  //
  // **Walked on its own clock.** Ore moves, but it moves at the speed a
  // harvester works, so re-reading every cell three times a second would be
  // `getObjectsOnTile` twenty thousand times a second to watch paint dry. The
  // ore rides the sweep at a divisor of its own, and the picture is rebuilt only
  // when a cell actually changed -- `revision`, the same mechanism the cover
  // uses, for the same reason.
  //
  // **Not gated by the shroud mask, and that is not an oversight.** The layer
  // goes on before the cover, which paints opaque black over every cell the
  // player has not scouted -- so the mask clips it exactly as it clips a blip,
  // one blit later and without this loop having to ask.
  //
  // **Filter off, like every other mark.** The backing is blitted under the
  // global brightness/contrast pair because it is the picture; a mark over it is
  // an annotation, and one dimmed exactly as far as the map beneath it is
  // exactly as hard to read. `oreAlpha` is the dial for how strongly it reads.

  // Our own `cellOrigin` is `dx = rx-ry + W-1`, `dy = rx+ry - W-1`, scaled by
  // `BLOCK.width/2 = 30` and `BLOCK.height/2 = 15`, lifted by the same `15*z`
  // and pushed down by `headroom`. Both spaces therefore share one pixel scale
  // **and** one elevation lift, so the difference between them is a constant:
  //
  //   ourX = pan.x + 30*W          ourY = pan.y - 15*(W+1) + headroom
  //
  // The elevation cancels, which is the part worth stating: nothing here has to
  // ask what the tile under the camera is standing on, and nothing has to invert
  // the ambiguous picture-to-cell mapping the pick buffer exists for.
  //
  // **The pan is the viewport's CENTRE, not its corner.** Not visible in

  // canvas size and no scale factor appears on the path. If one ever arrives the
  // rectangle grows or shrinks wrongly while staying centred, which is the

  // The marker the game puts on its own minimap when something happens to you:
  // your base is attacked, a harvester is attacked, an enemy superweapon is
  // detected, a cloaked unit is sensed, somebody drops a beacon, a map trigger
  // fires. It shrinks from fifteen times its size, spins, ping-pongs between
  // two colours and expires. Without it a player watching this panel instead of
  // the client's own loses the one thing that says *where* — which is the
  // opposite of what a radar is for.
  //
  // **Polled off the player's own trait, not subscribed to the event bus.** The
  // client's own `Minimap` subscribes to `EventType.RadarEvent` and then tests
  // `event.target === this.localPlayer`, because that bus carries every
  // player's events. Reading `player.radarTrait.activeEvents` instead reaches
  // only OUR events: the filter stops being a line of code that could be
  // deleted and becomes the shape of the read. Under a standing no-maphack
  // constraint that difference is the whole argument, and it costs nothing —
  // `RadarTrait#addEventForPlayer` pushes `{startTick, tile, type}` onto the
  // target's own trait and dispatches the event from the same block, so the
  // list is the dispatch. Polling also inherits this panel's lifetime for free,
  // where a subscription would need an unsubscribe wired to both the panel
  // closing and the match ending; the tick already polls the radar flag for the
  // same reason.
  //
  // **Two clocks, which is the client's own split.** A ping's LIFE is counted
  // in engine ticks (`game.currentTick - startTick >= visibility`) because that
  // is the clock its `startTick` is stamped in — no conversion, no drift, and
  // it reproduces "a ping lives shorter in real time at higher game speed"
  // without reading `game.speed.value` at all, which is one fewer client
  // surface that can move. The client reaches the same place from the other
  // end, dividing the duration by ticks-per-millisecond. A ping's ANIMATION is
  // counted in wall-clock milliseconds, `(now - seenAt)/1000*60`, literally the
  // client's expression: driving the spin off ticks would make it speed up with
  // the game, which the client's does not.
  //
  // Our own cull is not belt-and-braces. The trait prunes `activeEvents` only
  // when a NEW event is created, so an entry can sit there long past its
  // visibility duration with nothing to push it out.
  //
  // **Drawn over the cover, and NOT gated by `radarCellVisible`.** It is the
  // second of exactly two layers on this panel that are not — the viewport
  // rectangle is the other — and the exception is deliberate. An event's tile
  // may be unexplored by construction: `EnemyObjectSensed` fires when a
  // `RevealToAll` object spawns, and a map trigger fires at a waypoint. The
  // client draws its ping over its finished minimap unconditionally, so
  // clipping ours to scouted ground would make this panel worse than the game's
  // own, which is the opposite failure from the one the mask guards. And a ping
  // says nothing about the cell — not its owner, not what stands on it, not
  // even its terrain — only a coordinate the client has already handed the
  // local player.
  //
  // **It is a 2:1 rhombus on screen, not a square, and that is the clone.** The
  // client's ping is a square in `dxy`, the space its minimap is drawn rotated
  // into. Our render is unrotated iso, where one `dx` is half a cell wide and
  // one `dy` half a cell tall — 30px against 15px — so the same square in dxy
  // comes out twice as wide as it is tall here. Mapping it anisotropically is
  // what makes our ping bracket the same TILES the native one does, which is
  // the thing worth cloning across two different projections of one map. Do not
  // "fix" this into an axis-aligned square: that would keep the shape and lose
  // the meaning.

  /**
   * The two colours each event type swings between, read off the client's own
   * table at v0.83.3 (`gui/screen/game/component/Minimap`, the `Map` built over

  // global brightness/contrast pair, the two blip dials, the gap-field dim and
  // the shroud switch. Every one of those is absent from `tuneKey` — asserted
  // in scripts/check-radar.mjs by moving all of them and finding the stamp
  // still empty — so a match spent dragging them costs no re-render at all. The
  // per-layer dials and the two ore colours are baked, and they belong where
  // there is a big picture to judge them against.
  //
  // **They are not `<input type=range>`, and they cannot be.** The client holds
  // a pointer lock for the whole of a match: under it no DOM element can be
  // dragged, `clientX/clientY` freeze, and a wheel scrolls whatever is under the
  // position the cursor froze at. So a dial is a track you *click* — one press
  // anywhere along it sets the value, which needs no drag, no scroll and no
  // focus — and the right button puts it back to its default. The same two
  // presses work with a free mouse, so there is one behaviour rather than two.

  // --- interaction ------------------------------------------------------------
  //
  // What a press on the picture does, and the slice that turns a picture into a
  // radar: the left button orders, the right one moves the camera, and Alt with
  // the right one drops a beacon. The last of those is also the one gesture here
  // that works off the panel — `worldPing`, at the bottom, is the same beacon
  // out in the game world, which is where the user asked for it.
  //
  // **The two ordinary buttons are handed to the client's own minimap path
  // rather than reimplemented.** `WorldInteraction#executeMinimapClickCommand
  // (tile, wasRightClick)` is the method the client's own radar dispatches a
  // click into, and it carries four things that would each be a separate bug to
  // rebuild here. Read out of the bundle at v0.83.3:
  //
  //   executeMinimapClickCommand(tile, wasRightClick) {
  //     let ordered = false;
  //     if (wasRightClick === this.isRightClickMove()) {
  //       const hover = this.minimapHandler.getHover(tile);
  //       if (this.currentMode) { ...the mode consumes the click...
  //       } else ordered = this.defaultActionHandler.execute(hover, selected, ...);
  //     }
  //     ordered || this.minimapHandler.panToTile(tile);
  //   }
  //
  //   - **which button orders is a user setting** — `isRightClickMove()` is the
  //     client's own option, so a player who swapped the buttons there has them
  //     swapped here too, without this file knowing the option exists;
  //   - **what the order is** comes from `DefaultActionHandler`: move on open
  //     ground, attack on an enemy, capture under an engineer, repair, dock. A
  //     hardcoded `OrderType.Move` would be wrong on every one of those;
  //   - **a click mode wins over an order** — a building waiting to be placed or
  //     a superweapon waiting for a target consumes the click, exactly as it
  //     does on the client's own radar;
  //   - **the pan is the fallback, not a second branch.** A click that issues no
  //     order pans there, which is why a left click with nothing selected moves
  //     the camera on the native radar as well.
  //
  // Nothing here pushes an action of its own, and that is the point: `pushOrder`
  // would still have been ours to get right (the selection-sync action it sends
  // first, the duplicate dedupe, the acknowledgement sound), and a pan is local
  // render state that must not reach the wire at all.
  //
  // **The beacon is ours**, because the client has no one-click one:
  // `KeyCommandType.PlaceBeacon` is a mode you enter and then click with, and
  // the probe found it bound to nothing. `CombatantUi#handleBeacon(tile)` is the
  // call underneath that mode, and it carries the client's own rate limit
  // (`BeaconFxHandler#canPingLocation` — three live beacons, a third of a second
  // apart). Alt with the right button is free: `WorldInteraction`'s mousedown
  // path never reads `altKey`, and the client's own Alt bindings are all on the
  // *left* button's default action.

  //
  // **The client's three handlers do the whole of it**, and are called rather
  // than reimplemented, for the same reason `executeMinimapClickCommand` is:
  //
  //   handleMinimapMouseOver()      -> isMinimapHover = true
  //   handleMinimapMouseMove(tile)  -> getHover, then currentMode.hover
  //                                    or updateDefaultAction
  //   handleMinimapMouseOut()       -> pointer back to Default, flag cleared
  //
  // `updateDefaultAction` ends in
  // `pointer.setPointerType(defaultActionHandler.getPointerType(isMinimapHover))`,
  // so calling them IS the cursor feature -- there is no table of ours mapping
  // an object to an action, and no second opinion to drift from the click path
  // that runs a moment later.
  //
  // **The dangerous half is the flag, not the drawing.** `isMinimapHover` left
  // true after the cursor leaves makes `getCurrentHover()` hand a stale minimap
  // tile to `currentMode.execute` -- building placement, superweapon targeting
  // -- and to our own beacon. So the out-call is made from every path that can

   *   a naval unit to Ships rather than Vehicles.
   * - **whether the order stands** — `UpdateQueueAction#process` re-checks
   *   availability as it runs, on every client, so an order that should not
   *   have been accepted is dropped identically everywhere and cannot desync.
   *
   * The action goes onto the same `actionQueue` the mouse feeds, with identical
   * serialisation. One press is one item.

   * has had since the client's v0.79 and no key of the client's own reaches.

   * check, the queue, the clamp and the ready/held branches above are the same
   * question either way. What it does to the queue is `insertAfterFirst`, and

  /**
   * The keyboard lock — the mechanism a fullscreen game uses to keep Ctrl+W,
   * which is the user's own observation and it is right: `navigator.keyboard`
   * hands the page every key **while the document is fullscreen**, browser
   * shortcuts included.
   *
   * **There is one lock per page, and the client is already using it.** That is
   * the correction 0.60.1 is: `keyboard.lock(codes)` *replaces* the locked set
   * rather than adding to it, and the client locks `Escape, F5, F12, F11` on
   * entering fullscreen — `onFullScreenChange` — precisely so that Escape
   * reaches the game instead of leaving fullscreen. Locking our four tab keys
   * released that. The next Escape then left fullscreen, **and leaving
   * fullscreen ends the lock altogether**, so Ctrl+W went back to closing the
   * tab: the feature worked exactly until the first Escape, with nothing to see
   * in between.
   *
   * So neither side calls the API directly any more. `hookKeyboard` wraps it,
   * every request — the client's and ours — is recorded, and what actually goes
   * out is the union (`chordKeyLockPlan`). Nobody can take anybody's keys away.
   *
   * Two things still bound what we ask for, and both are deliberate:
   *
   * - **Only in a match, and only in the game's own fullscreen.** `F11` browser
   *   fullscreen leaves `document.fullscreenElement` null and the lock inert,
   *   which is a caveat rather than a bug: the API is defined against the
   *   Fullscreen API's element, and the client has its own button.
   * - **Off by preference.** Someone who closes tabs with Ctrl+W and means it
   *   turns this off, and Ctrl+W then does what it always did — while the
   *   client's own Escape lock, which is none of our business, stays untouched.
   *   What they give up since 0.70.0 is "queue next" on the grid's `w` and `t`
   *   slots; every other slot keeps it.
   *
   * **What is asked for moved in 0.70.0 and the reason did not.** The lock was
   * held for the four sidebar tab keys, because the cancel key was Ctrl and one
   * of the tabs is `w`. The cancel is on Alt now, which the browser does not
   * reserve — but Ctrl became "queue next" over the whole chord grid, whose
   * second and fifth slots are `w` and `t`. So the same two codes are held for
   * the opposite command, and `ctrlKeysToHold` derives them from the keys we
   * actually take a Ctrl on rather than naming them.

  // --- Collapsing the sidebar -----------------------------------------------

  /**
   * The client's whole right-hand sidebar, hidden, with its power bar kept and
   * moved flush to the right edge of the screen.
   *
   * **Why there is anything left to hide.** Between the chord grid, the
   * production panel and the key badges, everything the sidebar is *for* has a
   * key now — the tabs, the cameos, the queue depth, the cancel — except one
   * thing: the power bar, which no key can replace because it is not a command
   * but a reading you glance at. So this is not "hide the HUD", it is "keep the
   * one part of it that is information".
   *
   * **Three moves, and the third is the point.**
   *
   * 1. The sidebar's own container is hidden. It carries no `ref` in the
   *    client's jsx — the refs inside it name the pieces, never the box — so it
   *    is found rather than named: the one HUD child whose subtree holds the
   *    power bar. An index into `getChildren()` would be the other way to say
   *    it, and would be a guess about a render tree we do not own.
   *    `sidebarButtonsContainer` is a second HUD child and is hidden with it.
   * 2. The power bar is reparented onto the HUD and put at
   *    `viewport.width - powerp.width`. Reparented rather than left where it is,
   *    because it lives *inside* the container being hidden and
   *    `gui/PointerEvents` gates a hit on the whole visibility chain — the same
   *    property that makes hiding enough to stop clicks makes it too much to
   *    keep one child visible. `SidebarPower#onFrame` writes `visible` and
   *    nothing else, so a position set here stays set.
   * 3. The world's viewport is widened into the freed strip, by the override on
   *    `WorldView#computeWorldViewport`. Without it the strip is the renderer's
   *    clear colour: `engine/gfx/Renderer` clears the canvas once a frame and
   *    then gives each scene its own `setViewport`, and the world's is
   *    `screen.width - hud.sidebarWidth` wide. `handleViewportChange` is the
   *    client's own re-apply and carries the camera's pan limits with it, so the
   *    view can reach the map edge the strip revealed rather than stopping where
   *    a narrower screen used to stop.
   *
   * Read out of `ra2web.min.js` v0.83.3 on 2026-08-24.

   * keys are **F5 to F12** (the shipped `[Hotkey]` table binds `Taunt_1`..`8` to
   * 116..123), and a browser keeps the top of that range for itself — F11 is
   * fullscreen and F12 is devtools, neither cancellable from a page. So two of
   * the eight are unreachable on a stock install and the rest are a hand off the
   * keyboard. This puts them under the left hand and, because that is the same
   * fix the client's own Keyboard options offer, also rebinds them **in the
   * client** rather than shadowing them from outside.
   *
   * What it draws over is `state.combatant.tauntHandler` — the object
   * `CombatantUi` builds per match and hands every taunt command to. Three facts
   * come off it that a player otherwise has to guess: whether the connection is
   * open at all (`sendTaunt` returns in silence when it is not), how much of the
   * five-second cooldown is left, and — through `Engine.taunts` — whether the

  /**
   * The numbers the client's own `ToggleFps` panel draws, read at their source
   * and written as text instead of as three stats.js graphs.
   *
   * What the client does, read out of v0.83.3: `GameScreen#initNetStats` builds
   * a `PingMonitor` at match start **whatever the FPS flag says** and calls
   * `monitor()`. The flag decides two other things — whether a `NetStats` exists
   * to paint the samples, and how often they are taken (1s with the panel up,
   * 10s with it down). So the values are there for the reading with the client's
   * panel closed; only their freshness depends on it, which is what
   * `syncNetCadence` below is about.
   *
   * One hook is the whole capture, because the `PingMonitor` instance carries
   * the other two objects worth reading:
   *
   *   - **RTT** — `onNewSample`, an IRC ping to the game server, and `avgPing`
   *     is the client's own median over the match. A reservoir sample of 100,
   *     so it is the median of a sample of the match, not of all of it.
   *   - **LAT** — `gameTurnMgr` is the `LockstepManager`, and the gap between
   *     `onActionsSent` and `onActionsReceived` for one network turn is how long
   *     an order of yours takes to come back. That is the number that decides
   *     how a press feels; RTT only says how far away the server is.
   *   - **lag** — `onLagStateChange`, the client's own "waiting for the other
   *     clients" state, raised once a turn has been stuck past its threshold.
   *   - **the rate** — `networkTurnMillis` against `gameTurnMillis`: the server
   *     stretches the network turn to the slowest player, so this is where the
   *     cost of somebody else's connection shows up.
   *
   * FPS is the one number that is ours rather than the client's:
   * `renderer.getStats()` exists only while the client's panel is up, so this
   * counts its own frames on the same rAF instead of reading the widget.
   *
   * Per-player ping comes from somewhere else entirely and is read **passively**
   * — see `attachNet`.

   * One taunt's sound, as a data URL the options page can hand to an `<audio>`.
   *
   * Why it is a round trip at all: the taunt files are the player's own import
   * and live in the client's **origin-private file system**, which is per
   * origin. An extension page cannot open it — only a script running on
   * `game.chronodivide.com` can — so the settings page asks and this answers,
   * the same way the settings backup reads `keyboard.ini`.
   *
   * **The file on disk is not playable and has to be converted.** RA2 ships its
   * taunts as **4-bit IMA ADPCM** inside a RIFF wrapper, and no browser decodes
   * that: an `<audio>` handed one answers *"Failed to load because no supported
   * source was found"*, which is exactly what a player reported against 1.17.3.
   * The client never uses `<audio>` — `WavFile#getData` runs the same
   * `wavefile` conversion (`bitDepth === "4"` → `fromIMAADPCM()` → `toBuffer()`)
   * that its own mixer is fed from — so this borrows the client's own decoder
   * and ships PCM. A file that is already PCM round-trips through the same call
   * unharmed, so there is nothing to branch on.
   *
   * `FileReader` does the base64 rather than a hand-rolled `btoa` loop — the
   * same encoding, without the chunking a 60 KB `String.fromCharCode.apply`
   * needs to avoid blowing the stack.
   *
   * An absence answers `missing` rather than throwing, and carries **why**: a
   * player told only "not found" cannot tell an install that never imported the
   * folder from a client that had not finished starting, and those two want
   * opposite things done about them.
