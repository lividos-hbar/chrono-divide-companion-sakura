/**
 * The shipped chord layouts name real objects, in real slots, once each.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-chords.mjs
 *
 * A chord layout is a table of object ids written by hand — the one part of this
 * feature nothing else validates, because a wrong id does not throw: the grid
 * draws a tile with no picture and the key quietly does nothing in a match,
 * which looks exactly like a prerequisite that is not up yet. So the ids are
 * checked against the two committed tables that know what an object is, and the
 * geometry is checked against the key block it claims to mirror.
 *
 * What it cannot check is whether a side can actually build what its layout
 * offers: ownership is prerequisites, not the `Owner=` list, and the answer
 * lives in a running match. That is what the dimmed tile in the grid is for.
